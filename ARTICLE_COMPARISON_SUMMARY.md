## Recommendations

- **Reason:** Content is identical; only category improvement needed

### 2. Nephilim Article
- **Decision:** Keep existing
- **Action:** None (new version doesn't exist)
- **Reason:** Comprehensive article already exists

### 3. Book of Enoch Article
- **Decision:** Keep existing
- **Action:** None
- **Reason:** Articles are identical

---

## Key Findings

1. **Goliath:** New version is essentially identical (only 2-word difference). Only improvement is better category tagging (`"pre-flood-age"` added).

2. **Nephilim:** New version does NOT exist in outputs directory. The file `outputs/nephilim-article.mdx` is missing.

3. **Book of Enoch:** New version is identical to existing (0-word difference). No changes needed.

4. **All existing articles** are well-optimized and comprehensive.

5. **No merging needed** - articles are either identical or new versions don't exist.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update Goliath article categories to include `"pre-flood-age"`
2. ✅ Keep all existing articles (they're comprehensive)
3. ✅ Delete duplicate files from outputs (or keep as backups)
4. ⚠️ **Investigate:** Where is the new Nephilim article? It's not in outputs directory.
