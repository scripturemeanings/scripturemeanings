# The Anakim: Giants Who Made Israel Feel Like Grasshoppers

When twelve Israelite spies returned from scouting the Promised Land, ten of them brought a report that paralyzed an entire nation with fear:

> *"We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."* (Numbers 13:33, NIV)

The **Anakim** were a race of giants so imposing, so fearsome, that seasoned warriors—men who had witnessed God's miracles in Egypt and at the Red Sea—felt like insects in comparison. This encounter at Kadesh Barnea became one of Israel's darkest moments, leading to forty years of wilderness wandering and the death of an entire generation.

But who were the Anakim? Why were they so terrifying? And how did one man—Caleb the son of Jephunneh—have the faith to defeat what an entire nation feared?

Understanding the Anakim reveals profound truths about fear, faith, and the ongoing battle against the [giant bloodlines descended from the Nephilim](/nephilim-giants-bible-meaning). Their story demonstrates that the size of your giant matters less than the size of your God.

## Who Were the Anakim?

The **Anakim** (Hebrew: **עֲנָקִים**, *Anaqim*) were a clan of giants who inhabited Canaan before Israel's conquest. Their name derives from **Anak** (עֲנָק, *Anaq*), meaning "long-necked" or "giant"—a fitting description for people of extraordinary height.

### Biblical Introduction

The Anakim first appear in Moses's account of Canaan's inhabitants:

> *"The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites."* (Deuteronomy 2:10-11, NIV)

The text explicitly compares them to other giant clans and identifies them as **Rephaites** (or Rephaim), one of the ancient giant races mentioned throughout Scripture.

### Connection to the Nephilim

The most significant detail comes from the spies' report:

> *"We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim)."* (Numbers 13:33, NIV)

This verse establishes the Anakim's lineage: they were **descendants of the Nephilim**, the giant offspring of [the Watchers who descended at Mount Hermon](/mount-hermon-bible-meaning) before the Flood (Genesis 6:1-4).

**The theological question**: How could Nephilim descendants exist after the Flood supposedly destroyed all flesh except Noah's family?

**Possible explanations**:

1. **Genetic transmission**: The giant genes passed through Noah's daughters-in-law

2. **Second incursion**: Another (smaller) angelic rebellion after the Flood

3. **Hyperbolic description**: The spies used "Nephilim" as a comparison, not claiming literal genetic descent

4. **Pre-Flood survival**: The Flood was geographically limited (though this contradicts the biblical emphasis on universal judgment)

Regardless of the mechanism, Scripture clearly connects the Anakim to the pre-Flood giants, making them part of the ongoing conflict between God's people and the corrupted bloodlines.

### The Three Sons of Anak

Numbers 13:22 names three prominent Anakim leaders:

> *"They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived."* (Numbers 13:22, NIV)

**Ahiman** (אֲחִימָן) - "Brother of a gift"

**Sheshai** (שֵׁשַׁי) - Possibly "whitish" or "noble"

**Talmai** (תַּלְמַי) - "Furrowed" or "bold"

These three ruled Hebron, one of the most important cities in Canaan. Their presence there wasn't random—Hebron held deep significance:

- Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah there (Genesis 23)

- Sarah, Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah were buried there

- It was a patriarchal inheritance city

The Anakim occupying Hebron represented a spiritual affront: giant descendants of rebellion controlling the burial site of the faithful patriarchs.

## Where the Anakim Lived

The Anakim weren't scattered randomly across Canaan—they concentrated in specific strategic locations.

### Primary Territory: The Hill Country

> *"At that time I went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. I totally destroyed them and their towns."* (Joshua 11:21, NIV)

**Major Anakim strongholds**:

- **Hebron**: Capital city, ruled by Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai

- **Debir**: Southern hill country fortress city

- **Anab**: Town in southern Judah

- **Hill country of Judah**: The mountainous region south of Jerusalem

- **Hill country of Israel**: Northern highlands

### Post-Conquest Survival: Three Philistine Cities

After Joshua's conquest, remnants survived in only three locations:

> *"No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive."* (Joshua 11:22, NIV)

These three **Philistine** cities became the last refuges of the giant bloodline:

**Gaza**: Southwestern coastal city (one of five Philistine city-states)

**Gath**: Home of [Goliath and his brothers](/goliath-giants-spiritual-warfare) (the most famous Anakim)

**Ashdod**: Northern Philistine city, another coastal stronghold

This explains why the Philistines later fielded giant warriors like Goliath—they had absorbed and militarized the surviving Anakim population.

### Strategic Importance of Their Locations

The Anakim didn't just happen to live in these places—they controlled:

- **High ground**: Hill country provided military advantage

- **Water sources**: Critical for survival in the region

- **Ancient sites**: Hebron connected to Abraham's covenant

- **Strategic routes**: Control of hill country meant control of travel corridors

Their placement suggests either deliberate strategy or that they had held these territories since before Israel's arrival, possibly even since before the Flood if their lineage truly extended that far back.

## The Spies' Report: Fear Versus Faith

The encounter at Kadesh Barnea became Israel's defining moment of failure—a test they failed because they focused on the giants' size rather than God's power.

### The Mission (Numbers 13:1-20)

God commanded Moses to send twelve spies—one from each tribe—to scout Canaan:

> *"Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders."* (Numbers 13:2, NIV)

**Their assignment**:

- Observe the people (strong or weak, few or many)

- Check the land (good or bad, fertile or poor)

- Note the towns (fortified or unfortified)

- Bring back samples of the produce

They spent **forty days** exploring from the Desert of Zin to Rehob (Numbers 13:21-25).

### The Evidence: A Land Flowing with Milk and Honey

The spies returned with proof of Canaan's abundance:

> *"They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. They gave Moses this account: 'We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.'"* (Numbers 13:26-27, NIV)

They brought back:

- A cluster of grapes so large it required two men to carry it on a pole

- Pomegranates

- Figs

**The evidence was irrefutable**: God had told the truth. The land was everything He promised.

### The Problem: Giants in the Land

Then came the devastating "but":

> *"But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."* (Numbers 13:28-29, NIV)

The spies weren't lying. The challenges were real:

- **Powerful inhabitants**: Multiple warrior nations

- **Fortified cities**: Defensive walls and structures

- **The Anakim**: Giants specifically mentioned by name

But notice what they emphasized: the **obstacles**, not the **opportunity**.

### The Minority Report: Caleb's Faith

One voice broke through the fear:

> *"Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, 'We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.'"* (Numbers 13:30, NIV)

**Caleb didn't deny the giants existed.** He acknowledged the same facts as the other spies. The difference was his **perspective**:

- The ten spies saw: Giants + fortified cities = impossible

- Caleb saw: God + us = victory

### The Majority Report: Spreading Fear

The other ten spies doubled down on fear:

> *"But the men who had gone up with him said, 'We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are.' And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, 'The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.'"* (Numbers 13:31-33, NIV)

**Three destructive statements**:

1. **"We can't attack those people"** - Contradicted God's promise

2. **"The land devours those living in it"** - Slandered God's gift

3. **"We seemed like grasshoppers"** - Self-fulfilling prophecy of defeat

### The Grasshopper Complex

> *"We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."* (Numbers 13:33, NIV)

This single verse reveals the psychology of defeat:

**"In our own eyes"** - The problem wasn't how the Anakim saw them; it was how they saw **themselves**. They had a grasshopper **identity** before they had grasshopper circumstances.

**"And we looked the same to them"** - They projected their self-image onto the giants. There's no evidence the Anakim actually said this—the spies assumed it.

**The spiritual principle**: How you see yourself determines how you see your giant, which determines whether you'll even try to fight.

### The People's Response: Rebellion

Israel's reaction was catastrophic:

> *"That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud. All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, 'If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness! Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?' And they said to each other, 'We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.'"* (Numbers 14:1-4, NIV)

**Notice the progression**:

1. Corporate weeping and fear

2. Grumbling against God's appointed leaders

3. Wishing they had died earlier

4. Accusing God of evil intent

5. Plotting to return to slavery

6. Planning to appoint new leadership

Fear didn't just paralyze them—it turned them against God Himself.

### God's Judgment: Forty Years for Forty Days

> *"For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you."* (Numbers 14:34, NIV)

**The sentence**:

- The entire generation (except Caleb and Joshua) would die in the wilderness

- Israel would wander forty years—one year for each day of the spying mission

- Only those under twenty years old would enter the Promised Land

- The ten fearful spies died immediately by plague (Numbers 14:37)

**Why such harsh judgment?**

Because they didn't just lack courage—they rejected God's character:

- They called His promise a lie

- They accused Him of bringing them to die

- They preferred slavery to trusting Him

- They spread fear that infected an entire nation

The Anakim became the excuse for rejecting God's explicit promise.

## Caleb's Conquest: Faith Defeats Giants

Forty-five years later, an 85-year-old man finally got his chance to face the giants.

### Caleb's Request

After Joshua's initial conquest campaigns, Caleb approached him with a remarkable request:

> *"Now then, just as the Lord promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old! I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the Lord helping me, I will drive them out just as he said."* (Joshua 14:10-12, NIV)

**Notice what Caleb asked for**:

- Not the easy valley land

- Not the already-conquered territory

- But **Hebron**—the Anakim stronghold with **large, fortified cities** that had terrified Israel forty-five years earlier

At 85 years old, Caleb volunteered for the hardest fight.

### The Victory at Hebron

> *"Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the Lord, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly."* (Joshua 14:13-14, NIV)

**What happened next**:

> *"From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites—Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, the sons of Anak."* (Joshua 15:14, NIV)

The same three giants who had paralyzed Israel decades earlier fell to an 85-year-old man who trusted God.

### Caleb's Spiritual Qualifications

**Why could Caleb succeed where Israel failed?**

1. **Wholehearted devotion**: "He followed the Lord... wholeheartedly" (Joshua 14:14)

2. **Long obedience**: He maintained faith through forty years of wandering

3. **Unfading strength**: "I am still as strong today" (Joshua 14:11)

4. **Clear memory**: He remembered God's promise for forty-five years

5. **Volunteer spirit**: He asked for the hardest assignment

6. **God-centered confidence**: "The Lord helping me" (Joshua 14:12)

**The principle**: God gives giant-killing anointing to those who walk with Him wholeheartedly, regardless of age or circumstances.

### Joshua's Campaigns: Finishing the Job

Joshua completed the conquest of the Anakim:

> *"At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns. No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive."* (Joshua 11:21-22, NIV)

**The systematic destruction**:

- Hebron: Conquered by Caleb

- Debir: Captured by Othniel (Caleb's nephew - Joshua 15:15-17)

- Anab: Joshua's campaign

- Hill country of Judah: Cleared systematically

- Hill country of Israel: Northern territories cleared

Only three Philistine cities remained as Anakim refuges—and even these would later face [Israel's giant-killers like David](/goliath-giants-spiritual-warfare).

## The Anakim in Later History

Though largely destroyed, the Anakim bloodline persisted in the Philistine cities.

### Gath: The Giant Factory

**Gath** became the primary Anakim stronghold, producing multiple giant warriors:

**Goliath of Gath** (1 Samuel 17:4)

- Height: 6 cubits and a span (approximately 9 feet 9 inches, Masoretic text)

- Defeated by David

**Goliath's Brothers** (2 Samuel 21:15-22):

1. **Ishbi-Benob**: Bronze spear weighing 300 shekels (7.5 pounds), nearly killed David

2. **Saph**: Another "descendant of Rapha"

3. **Lahmi, brother of Goliath**: Spear shaft "like a weaver's rod"

4. **Unnamed giant**: Six fingers on each hand, six toes on each foot (24 digits total)

> *"These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."* (2 Samuel 21:22, NIV)

**The pattern**: The Anakim (Rephaim) in Gath continued producing giant warriors for generations after Joshua's conquest, until David and his mighty men finally eliminated them.

### Archaeological Evidence

While direct archaeological evidence of giants is debated, several findings are relevant:

**Large skeletal remains**: Occasionally discovered in the region, though often contested or explained as Acromegaly (growth hormone disorder)

**Massive fortifications**: Archaeological excavations at Hebron, Debir, and other Anakim cities reveal impressive defensive structures that would have seemed insurmountable to Bronze Age attackers

**Cultural memory**: Ancient Near Eastern texts from multiple cultures reference giant warriors and kings, suggesting widespread belief in their historical existence

**Philistine artifacts**: Archaeological evidence of Philistine culture in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod confirms these cities' importance and militaristic nature

## Spiritual Lessons: Defeating Your Anakim

The Anakim story isn't just ancient history—it provides timeless principles for facing overwhelming challenges.

### Lesson 1: Giants Are Real, But So Is God

**The ten spies' mistake**: Denying reality

**Caleb's wisdom**: Acknowledging reality while trusting a bigger reality

The Anakim genuinely were giants. The cities truly were fortified. The challenges were legitimate.

**But**: God was bigger than all of it.

**Modern application**: Don't minimize your problems ("It's not that bad"), but don't maximize them either ("It's impossible"). See them accurately, then see God more accurately.

### Lesson 2: Your Self-Image Determines Your Outcomes

> *"We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes..."* (Numbers 13:33)

**The progression of defeat**:

1. You see yourself as small

2. You project that smallness onto others

3. You act from that diminished identity

4. Your fears become self-fulfilling prophecies

**The progression of victory**:

1. You see yourself as God sees you (beloved, chosen, empowered)

2. You view challenges through that identity

3. You act from confidence in God's promises

4. Faith produces breakthrough

### Lesson 3: Fear Is Contagious—And So Is Faith

**The bad report** spread like wildfire:

- Ten men convinced 600,000 men to give up

- Corporate fear led to corporate rebellion

- An entire generation died because of one bad report

**Caleb's faith**, though minority, preserved:

- He and Joshua alone entered the Promised Land from their generation

- His family inherited Hebron

- His legacy inspired future generations

**Modern application**: Be careful whose voice you amplify. One fearful report can infect an entire community. One faithful voice can sustain hope through decades of wilderness.

### Lesson 4: Delayed Doesn't Mean Denied

**Caleb waited forty-five years** for his promise:

- Forty years wandering (punishment for Israel's unbelief)

- Five years of conquest campaigns

- Finally, at 85, he got his inheritance

**He never**:

- Forgot the promise

- Became bitter

- Lost his vigor

- Stopped believing

**Modern application**: God's delays test your faithfulness. What He promises, He will fulfill—but often not on your timeline. Keep walking with Him wholeheartedly through the wait.

### Lesson 5: Age Doesn't Disqualify You

**Caleb at 85**:

- "I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out"

- "I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then"

- Asked for the hardest assignment

- Defeated three giants

**The principle**: God doesn't retire His warriors. As long as you have breath, you have purpose. Your greatest victories might come in your later years.

### Lesson 6: Volunteer for the Hard Assignments

**Caleb could have asked for**:

- Valley land (easier to farm)

- Coastal territory (trade routes)

- Already-conquered cities (no fighting required)

**He chose**: The hill country with giants and fortified cities.

**Why?** Because:

- That's where God promised him

- That's where his faith shone brightest

- That's where his victory would inspire others

- That's where he could glorify God most

**Modern application**: Don't shy away from difficult assignments. God often gives His greatest anointing for the hardest tasks.

### Lesson 7: Remember Your Testimony

**Caleb's memory**:

- Remembered standing before the Anakim forty-five years earlier

- Remembered God's promise despite decades of waiting

- Remembered his wholeheartedness when others forgot

**The spies' memory**:

- Remembered their fear

- Remembered feeling like grasshoppers

- Forgot God's faithfulness in Egypt, at the Red Sea, at Mount Sinai

**Modern application**: What you choose to remember shapes your future. Remember God's faithfulness more than your failures.

## Conclusion: The Giants Fall

The Anakim seemed invincible. For forty days, twelve spies scouted Canaan, and ten returned paralyzed by what they saw. These giants—descendants of the Nephilim, imposing in stature, dwelling in fortified cities—appeared to be an insurmountable obstacle to God's promise.

But they weren't.

**One generation said**: "We're grasshoppers. We can't do it."

**The next generation said**: "The Lord is with us. We can."

The difference wasn't the size of the giants. The Anakim were just as tall when Caleb faced them at 85 as they were when the spies saw them forty-five years earlier.

The difference was **faith**.

**Caleb and Joshua believed**:

- God's promise outweighed present obstacles

- God's power exceeded human limitations

- God's presence guaranteed victory

- God's faithfulness never fails

And they were right.

Ahiman fell. Sheshai fell. Talmai fell. The fortified cities of Hebron, Debir, and Anab were conquered. The giant bloodline that had terrorized a generation was destroyed. The survivors who fled to Gath would later fall to David and his mighty men.

**The Anakim are gone. But the lessons remain.**

Whatever giant stands before you today—whatever seems impossible, whatever makes you feel like a grasshopper, whatever has paralyzed you with fear—**it's not bigger than your God**.

The same God who gave Canaan to Israel gives victory to His people today. The same God who empowered an 85-year-old man to defeat three giants empowers you to face yours.

So when your spies return with a frightening report, when the obstacles seem insurmountable, when fear whispers "you can't," remember Caleb's words:

**"We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."**

Not because you're strong enough. But because **the Lord is with you**.

And that makes all the difference.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Were the Anakim really giants or just tall people?**

The Hebrew text and biblical context strongly suggest they were abnormally tall. The spies' description ("We seemed like grasshoppers") and the explicit connection to the Nephilim indicate they were far beyond normal height variation. Whether 9+ feet or "merely" 7+ feet, they were imposing enough to terrify an entire generation of Israelites.

**Q: How could Nephilim descendants exist after the Flood?**

This is one of Scripture's mysteries. Possibilities include: (1) genetic transmission through Noah's daughters-in-law, (2) a second angelic incursion after the Flood, (3) the spies using "Nephilim" as a comparison rather than claiming literal descent, or (4) theological symbolism representing human rebellion. Numbers 13:33 clearly connects the Anakim to the Nephilim, but the mechanism isn't explained.

**Q: Why did God command the destruction of the Anakim?**

The Anakim represented the continuation of pre-Flood corruption—the mixing of angelic and human bloodlines that necessitated the Flood. God commanded their destruction as part of purging the land of influences that would lead Israel into idolatry and rebellion. This wasn't genocide based on ethnicity but judgment on spiritual corruption and its physical manifestations.

**Q: What happened to the Anakim who fled to Gath, Gaza, and Ashdod?**

They were absorbed into Philistine culture and continued as giant warriors for several generations. Goliath and his four brothers were descendants of these Anakim refugees. David and his mighty men eventually eliminated them completely (2 Samuel 21:22), fulfilling the complete conquest Joshua began.

**Q: Why did Caleb wait 45 years for his inheritance?**

Caleb had to wait through Israel's 40-year wilderness wandering (punishment for the nation's unbelief) plus approximately 5 years of Joshua's conquest campaigns. God honored Caleb's faithfulness but made him wait through the consequences of others' sins—a common biblical pattern where the righteous endure alongside the rebellious.

**Q: How could an 85-year-old man defeat three giants?**

Caleb attributed his strength to God: "The Lord helping me, I will drive them out" (Joshua 14:12). His physical vigor at 85 ("I am still as strong today") was miraculous—a reward for his wholehearted devotion. God's anointing overcame natural limitations, demonstrating that spiritual power trumps physical advantage.

**Q: What's the spiritual significance of Hebron for Caleb?**

Hebron was where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried—a patriarchal inheritance site. The Anakim occupying it represented giant descendants of rebellion controlling the burial place of the faithful. Caleb reclaiming it symbolized faith's victory over fear, righteousness overcoming corruption, and God's promises defeating every obstacle.
