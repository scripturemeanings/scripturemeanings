A dragon appears in your dream—scales glinting, breath scorching, presence overwhelming. You wake with heart racing, the image seared into memory. *What does this mean? Why would God show me a dragon?*

Dragons aren't merely fantasy creatures relegated to myths and children's stories. In Scripture, dragons represent profound spiritual realities—cosmic warfare, ancient evil, divine judgment, and ultimate victory. When dragons enter our dreams, they often signal spiritual battles, prophetic warnings, or revelations about unseen realms.

This comprehensive guide explores dragons in dreams through a biblical lens, examining what Scripture teaches about these creatures, how to interpret dragon symbolism, and what God might be communicating through these powerful nocturnal visions.

## Dragons in Scripture: Biblical Foundation for Dream Interpretation

### The Great Red Dragon of Revelation

The Bible's most explicit dragon imagery appears in Revelation 12:

> "Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth... The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray." (Revelation 12:3-4, 9)

**This passage establishes critical truths:**

**Dragons represent Satan and demonic powers.** The dragon isn't symbolic of generic evil—John identifies it explicitly as "that ancient serpent... the devil, or Satan." Dragon imagery in dreams often indicates satanic opposition, spiritual warfare, or demonic activity.

**Dragons possess immense but limited power.** Seven heads, ten horns, seven crowns—symbols of intelligence, strength, and authority. Yet despite this power, the dragon is "hurled down" and ultimately defeated. Dragons may appear terrifying in dreams, but they're already conquered enemies.

**Dragons war against God's people.** Revelation 12 describes the dragon pursuing the woman (representing God's people) and making war against her offspring. Dragon dreams may indicate spiritual attack, persecution, or the enemy's schemes against believers.

**Dragons deceive the whole world.** Satan's primary tactic isn't brute force but deception. Dragon dreams sometimes expose lies, false teachings, or areas where the enemy has gained foothold through deception.

### Leviathan: The Sea Dragon of Job

Job 41 provides the Bible's most detailed dragon description—Leviathan, the terrifying sea creature:

> "Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down its tongue with a rope?... Any hope of subduing it is false; the mere sight of it is overpowering... Nothing on earth is its equal—a creature without fear. It looks down on all that are haughty; it is king over all that are proud." (Job 41:1, 9, 33-34)

**Leviathan teaches us:**

**Pride is the dragon's essence.** God describes Leviathan as "king over all that are proud." The dragon represents pride—Satan's original sin (Isaiah 14:12-15) and humanity's perpetual temptation. Dragon dreams often expose pride in our hearts or warn against prideful attitudes.

**Human power cannot defeat the dragon.** Job 41 emphasizes Leviathan's imperviousness to human weapons—arrows bounce off, swords cannot pierce, fire doesn't burn. Only divine power conquers the dragon. Dreams of fighting dragons may reveal our need to rely on God rather than human strength.

**The dragon terrorizes but God controls.** Despite Leviathan's fearsome description, God made it and controls it (Psalm 104:26). Dragon dreams, though frightening, ultimately display God's sovereignty over evil.

### The Ancient Serpent: Eden to Revelation

Scripture links dragons to the serpent from Eden:

**Genesis 3:** The serpent deceives Eve, introducing sin and death. Though not called a dragon here, later Scripture identifies the serpent with the dragon (Revelation 12:9, 20:2).

**Isaiah 27:1:** "In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword—his fierce, great and powerful sword—Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea."

**This serpent-dragon connection means:**

- Dragon dreams may relate to temptation and deception (Eden pattern)
- They might indicate ancient spiritual forces at work
- They can symbolize the curse of sin and its effects
- They may prophesy divine judgment on evil

### Ancient Near Eastern Dragon Mythology and Biblical Polemic

Israel's neighbors worshiped dragon-gods—Tiamat (Babylon), Yamm (Canaan), Apep (Egypt). These chaos monsters represented forces opposed to creation order.

**The Bible's counter-narrative:**

- Pagan: Dragons are gods to be feared and appeased
- Biblical: Dragons are created beings God judges and defeats

**For dream interpretation:** Dragon dreams in ancient times might have tempted Israelites toward pagan spirituality. Today, they still can indicate:

- Spiritual powers behind false religions
- Cultural/societal forces opposing God's order
- New Age or occult influences
- Idolatry in various forms

## Types of Dragon Dreams and Their Spiritual Meanings

Dragon dreams vary widely. Understanding common patterns aids interpretation.

### 1. Fighting or Battling a Dragon

**Dream scenario:** You're engaged in combat with a dragon—sword fighting, running, defending others.

**Potential meanings:**

**Active spiritual warfare:** You're currently in significant spiritual battle—resisting temptation, standing for truth, or fighting for others' freedom. The dream reflects invisible spiritual reality.

**Confronting pride:** Either your own pride or another's. The dragon represents arrogance, self-righteousness, or rebellion that must be defeated.

**Prophetic preparation:** God may be preparing you for coming spiritual conflict. The dream equips you emotionally and spiritually for battles ahead.

**Ministry calling:** Some believers are called to specific spiritual warfare ministry—intercession, deliverance, or prophetic confrontation. Fighting dragons may indicate this calling.

**Biblical parallel:** Michael the archangel fighting the dragon (Revelation 12:7-9). Your dream participation mirrors cosmic spiritual warfare.

**Discernment questions:**

- Are you winning or losing? (Reveals faith level or need for reinforcement)
- What weapons do you use? (Sword = Word of God; prayer; authority in Jesus' name)
- Who fights with you? (Community or isolation in spiritual battle)

### 2. Being Chased by a Dragon

**Dream scenario:** A dragon pursues you—flying, breathing fire, hunting relentlessly.

**Potential meanings:**

**Spiritual attack or harassment:** The enemy is targeting you, attempting to instill fear, discourage faith, or drive you from God's purposes.

**Unresolved sin or guilt:** Like Adam and Eve hiding from God, you may be running from conviction, refusing to deal with known sin.

**Avoidance of calling:** God may have called you to something you're resisting—ministry, obedience, sacrifice. The dragon represents consequences of disobedience or fear preventing forward movement.

**Persecution anxiety:** You may be anticipating or experiencing persecution for faith. The dream externalizes fear.

**Biblical parallel:** Elijah fleeing Jezebel (1 Kings 19). Though powerful in spiritual warfare, fear drove him to run. The dragon may represent magnified threats.

**Discernment questions:**

- Why are you running? (Fear, guilt, exhaustion, wisdom?)
- Can you turn and face it? (Confronting issues vs. perpetual avoidance)
- Does anything protect you? (God's presence, others' prayers, scriptural truth)

### 3. Observing Dragons from a Distance

**Dream scenario:** You see dragons but aren't directly threatened—watching battles, seeing dragons in cages, or observing from safety.

**Potential meanings:**

**Spiritual insight granted:** God may be revealing spiritual realities normally hidden—showing demonic activity, exposing enemy schemes, or unveiling spiritual dynamics in situations.

**Prophetic vision:** You're seeing what's coming—spiritual battles others will face, societal spiritual warfare, or end-times events.

**Intercessor's perspective:** God positions intercessors to see battles so they can pray effectively. Distance allows strategic prayer rather than personal survival mode.

**Preparatory revelation:** Before entering battle, God shows you the opposition so you won't be surprised or overwhelmed.

**Biblical parallel:** Daniel's visions of beasts and cosmic battles (Daniel 7-8). God showed him spiritual realities governing empires and ages.

**Discernment questions:**

- What specifically do you see? (Details matter in prophetic visions)
- What emotions do you feel? (Peace suggests revelation; anxiety may indicate personal processing)
- Who else is present? (Community often validates prophetic observation)

### 4. Befriending or Taming a Dragon

**Dream scenario:** A dragon becomes friendly, obedient, or protective rather than threatening.

**Potential meanings—PROCEED WITH CAUTION:**

This dream type requires extreme discernment because it can indicate:

**⚠️ WARNING INTERPRETATION (Most Common):**

**Compromise with evil:** Befriending what should be opposed. This may indicate:

- Tolerating sin rather than resisting
- Accommodating false teaching
- Making peace with worldliness
- Spiritual deception making evil appear good

**Satanic deception:** The enemy masquerading as angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). What appears friendly is actually dangerous.

**Desensitization to spiritual danger:** Growing comfortable with what should alarm you—entertainment glorifying evil, relationships pulling from God, or philosophies contradicting Scripture.

**✅ RARE POSITIVE INTERPRETATION:**

**Authority over spiritual forces:** In rare cases, believers operating in deliverance or spiritual warfare ministry may dream of commanding demonic forces to cease. This isn't "befriending" but exercising Christ's authority—the dragon submits unwillingly to divine power.

**Victory visualization:** Seeing defeated enemies as harmless may represent faith that evil is already conquered through Christ.

**Biblical parallel:** Jesus' authority over demons (Mark 5:1-20)—they obeyed but weren't friends. Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6)—beasts tamed by divine intervention, not natural friendship.

**Critical discernment:** If you dream of friendly dragons, test rigorously:

- Does it align with Scripture's view of Satan as enemy?
- Are you compromising biblically somewhere in waking life?
- Do you sense peace or unsettled spirit about the dream?
- What do mature believers say when you share it?

### 5. Multiple Dragons or Dragon Armies

**Dream scenario:** Not one dragon but many—hordes attacking, armies gathering, or multiple dragons with different attributes.

**Potential meanings:**

**Widespread spiritual warfare:** Corporate or cultural level spiritual battle—not just personal but affecting families, churches, communities, or nations.

**Coordinated demonic strategy:** Ephesians 6:12 mentions rulers, authorities, powers, spiritual forces—hierarchical demonic organization. Multiple dragons may represent coordinated spiritual attack.

**End-times intensification:** Revelation describes increasing demonic activity as history approaches culmination. Multiple dragons might indicate prophetic awareness of this intensification.

**Stronghold revelation:** Different dragons may represent different types of spiritual strongholds—addiction, false teaching, division, sexual immorality—all operating simultaneously.

**Biblical parallel:** Legion—multiple demons in one man (Mark 5:9). Jesus confronted not one but a coordinated demonic presence.

**Discernment questions:**

- Are the dragons identical or distinct? (Unified or varied spiritual opposition)
- What's the scale—personal, community, or global? (Determines prayer scope)
- Does Scripture or world events correlate? (Prophetic dreams often align with observable spiritual dynamics)

### 6. Dragon Eggs or Baby Dragons

**Dream scenario:** You discover dragon eggs, baby dragons hatching, or small dragons growing.

**Potential meanings:**

**⚠️ WARNING INTERPRETATION (Primary):**

**Seeds of destruction:** Small compromises, hidden sins, or seemingly minor issues that will grow into major spiritual problems. Jesus said sin starts small but produces death (James 1:14-15).

**Generational patterns:** Sins or spiritual strongholds being passed to the next generation—children or spiritual children. What seems small now will grow and dominate if not addressed.

**False teaching spreading:** Heresies often start subtly, appearing harmless initially. Baby dragons may represent false doctrines infiltrating subtly but destined to cause massive damage.

**✅ POSITIVE INTERPRETATION (Rare):**

**Early detection:** God's mercy exposing problems while they're still small and manageable. You can deal with "baby dragons" now before they become unconquerable.

**Prophetic warning:** Seeing what's coming gives opportunity for prevention. The dream prompts spiritual vigilance and preemptive spiritual warfare.

**Biblical parallel:** David killing bear and lion before facing Goliath (1 Samuel 17:34-37)—dealing with smaller threats prepared him for greater ones.

**Action steps:** If you dream of baby dragons:

- Examine life for "small" sins being tolerated
- Check for subtle compromises in relationships or lifestyle
- Investigate whether false teaching is infiltrating subtly
- Address issues now before they grow

### 7. Slaying or Defeating Dragons

**Dream scenario:** You successfully kill, defeat, or cast down a dragon—experiencing victory, seeing it destroyed, or watching it flee.

**Potential meanings:**

**Spiritual breakthrough:** Current spiritual battles are being won. God is granting victory over specific strongholds, temptations, or spiritual opposition.

**Prophetic declaration:** The dream declares what will happen—you will overcome, the enemy will be defeated, victory is certain. Faith to believe victory increases.

**Ministry fruit:** Your prayers, warfare, or spiritual labor is bearing fruit. Dragons falling represent strongholds crumbling in people, situations, or territories you've been interceding for.

**Encouragement in battle:** When warfare feels overwhelming, God shows you the outcome to strengthen faith. You'll win because Christ already won.

**Biblical parallel:** "They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11). Victory is assured through Christ.

**Discernment questions:**

- How was victory achieved? (Christ's blood, Word of God, prayer—valid methods)
- Who gets glory? (If you're the hero, check pride; if God receives glory, genuine)
- What follows victory? (Freedom, joy, peace indicate true spiritual victory)

## Dragon Colors and Symbolic Meanings

Dragon colors carry symbolic significance rooted in biblical color symbolism.

### Red Dragons

**Biblical reference:** Revelation 12:3—"enormous red dragon"

**Symbolic meanings:**

- **Bloodshed and violence:** Red represents blood, death, persecution
- **Wrath and judgment:** Divine or satanic anger
- **Political/military power:** Red often symbolizes earthly kingdoms and warfare
- **Martyrdom:** The dragon persecutes unto death

**Dream interpretation:** Red dragons often indicate:

- Violent spiritual attack or persecution
- Anger or rage (spiritual or human)
- Bloodguilt or violence in situations
- End-times persecution intensifying

### Black Dragons

**Symbolic meanings (cultural + biblical synthesis):**

- **Death and mourning:** Black represents death, grief, darkness
- **Hidden evil:** What operates in darkness, secret sin, occult activity
- **Famine and lack:** Black horse in Revelation brings famine (Revelation 6:5-6)
- **Depression and despair:** Spiritual oppression, hopelessness

**Dream interpretation:** Black dragons may indicate:

- Death threats (physical or spiritual)
- Hidden demonic activity being exposed
- Depression or spiritual oppression
- Economic or spiritual famine

### White/Silver Dragons

**⚠️ EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED**

White typically represents purity, holiness, righteousness in Scripture. **However, Satan masquerades as angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14).**

**Possible interpretations:**

**Deceptive appearance:** The dragon looks holy/good but remains evil—false teachers, counterfeit spirituality, "Christian" movements teaching heresy.

**Religious spirits:** Demonic forces operating through religious structures, legalism, or false holiness.

**Rare positive:** If the white creature isn't dragon-like but clearly angelic, it might represent divine messenger. But if distinctly dragon-shaped, assume deception.

**Dream interpretation:** White dragons almost always indicate:

- False teaching appearing biblical
- Religious deception
- Counterfeit spirituality
- Need for discernment in "spiritual" matters

### Gold/Golden Dragons

**Symbolic meanings:**

- **Idolatry:** Golden calf (Exodus 32)—making gods of wealth, power, self
- **Worldly glory:** Nebuchadnezzar's golden image (Daniel 3)—human empire opposing God
- **Material seduction:** Love of money, greed, materialism as spiritual bondage

**Dream interpretation:** Golden dragons suggest:

- Materialism or greed as spiritual stronghold
- Success/prosperity as idol
- Worldly kingdoms opposing God's kingdom
- Mammon worship (Matthew 6:24)

### Green Dragons

**Symbolic meanings:**

- **False religion:** Environmentalism/nature worship as substitute for Creator worship
- **Jealousy and envy:** Green culturally associated with these sins
- **Growth of evil:** What's growing but shouldn't be

**Dream interpretation:** Green dragons may indicate:

- New Age or earth-worship spirituality
- Environmental ideology becoming idolatrous
- Jealousy or envy as spiritual problem
- False teaching "growing" and spreading

## Spiritual Warfare: Responding to Dragon Dreams

Dragon dreams aren't merely informational—they're calls to action. How should believers respond?

### 1. Don't Fear—Stand Firm

**1 John 4:4:** "The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world."

Dragon dreams may be terrifying, but remember:

- Christ already defeated Satan (Colossians 2:15)
- You have authority in Jesus' name (Luke 10:19)
- Greater is He in you than any spiritual enemy

**Response:** Declare Christ's victory. Refuse to live in fear. Stand on Scripture's promises.

### 2. Put On the Full Armor of God

**Ephesians 6:10-18** isn't poetic—it's practical spiritual warfare instruction.

After dragon dreams:

- **Belt of truth:** Combat lies with truth. What lies is the enemy speaking?
- **Breastplate of righteousness:** Live rightly. Unconfessed sin gives dragons footholds.
- **Gospel shoes:** Stand firm in gospel assurance.
- **Shield of faith:** Deflect fiery darts with active trust in God.
- **Helmet of salvation:** Protect your mind with security in Christ.
- **Sword of Spirit:** Use Scripture offensively against enemy lies.
- **Prayer:** Engage in persistent, Spirit-led intercession.

### 3. Submit to God, Resist the Devil

**James 4:7:** "Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."

**Order matters:** Submit first, resist second.

**Practical application:**

- Confess any sin the Holy Spirit reveals
- Surrender areas of rebellion or independence
- THEN command the enemy to flee in Jesus' name
- Don't try to "resist" without first "submitting"

### 4. Pray with Others

Dragon dreams often indicate battles too large for solo engagement. Spiritual warfare requires community.

**Ecclesiastes 4:12:** "Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken."

**Action steps:**

- Share dreams with mature believers
- Request prayer covering
- Fast and pray corporately
- Consider whether spiritual warfare team or deliverance ministry is needed

### 5. Examine Your Life for Open Doors

Demons gain access through open doors—areas where sin, deception, or spiritual compromise invited them.

**Common open doors:**

- Unforgiveness or bitterness
- Sexual immorality
- Occult involvement (past or present)
- False teaching embraced
- Generational sins not renounced
- Unhealed trauma creating strongholds

**After dragon dreams, prayerfully ask:**

- "Lord, how did the enemy gain access?"
- "What doors need closing?"
- "Where am I compromising?"

Then repent, renounce, and close those doors through Christ's authority.

## Prophetic Dragon Dreams: End-Times Indicators

Some dragon dreams are prophetic—revealing spiritual dynamics in coming days.

### Signs a Dragon Dream May Be Prophetic

**1. Alignment with Revelation 12-13:** Dreams mirroring Revelation's dragon imagery may indicate end-times awareness.

**2. Unusual clarity and detail:** Prophetic dreams often have vivid, memorable quality—specific features, colors, actions.

**3. Burden for nations or church:** If the dream extends beyond personal experience to broader spiritual warfare affecting many, it may be prophetic.

**4. Witness in spirit:** Deep internal confirmation this dream matters beyond personal application.

**5. Subsequent confirmation:** Events, Scripture, or other believers' words validate the dream's significance.

### Common Prophetic Dragon Dream Themes

**Increased demonic activity in final days:**

"Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short" (Revelation 12:12).

**Dragon pursuing the church:**

Revelation 12:13-17 describes dragon warring against believers. Prophetic dreams may show this intensifying persecution.

**False signs and wonders:**

Revelation 13 describes the beast performing miraculous signs. Dragon dreams may expose counterfeit spiritual movements.

**Ultimate dragon defeat:**

Revelation 20 shows Satan bound and ultimately destroyed. Prophetic dreams often end with dragon's defeat, reminding us victory is certain.

## How to Interpret Your Dragon Dreams: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Record Details Immediately

Upon waking, write or voice-record:

- Dragon's appearance (color, size, features)
- Your role (fighting, running, observing)
- Other people present
- Setting and context
- Emotions felt
- Any words spoken
- Dream's outcome
- Your waking emotional state

### Step 2: Pray for Discernment

Before analyzing, ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom. God wants to reveal meaning (Daniel 2:28). Approach humbly, knowing you might misunderstand.

### Step 3: Examine Current Spiritual State

Consider:

- Are you in active spiritual warfare currently?
- What temptations are you facing?
- Any unconfessed sin?
- Recent spiritual victories or defeats?
- Church or ministry battles?

Dreams often connect to waking spiritual realities.

### Step 4: Search Scripture

Look for biblical parallels:

- How does Scripture depict dragons/serpents?
- What do biblical dragon defeats teach?
- Are there prophetic passages that correlate?

Let Scripture interpret Scripture.

### Step 5: Test Against Biblical Truth

Does the dream interpretation:

- Align with God's character?
- Agree with scriptural principles?
- Produce godly fruit (peace, wisdom, faith)?
- Point to Christ's victory?

Any interpretation contradicting Scripture is false.

### Step 6: Seek Wise Counsel

Share with spiritually mature believers who:

- Have discernment gift
- Know you well
- Have spiritual warfare experience
- Can pray with you

### Step 7: Respond Appropriately

Based on interpretation:

- Repent if sin exposed
- Engage spiritual warfare if under attack
- Pray for others if intercession indicated
- Prepare if prophetic warning given
- Praise God if victory revealed

## Common Questions About Dragon Dreams

**Q: Are dragon dreams always about spiritual warfare?**

Primarily, yes. Scripture's dragon symbolism is consistently negative—representing Satan, evil, or spiritual opposition. However, context matters. Rarely, dragon imagery might simply represent:

- Overwhelming challenges (using cultural metaphor)
- Fear being processed
- Power or strength (non-spiritual)

But given biblical precedent, assume spiritual warfare until proven otherwise.

**Q: Can Christians have dragon dreams, or only non-believers?**

Believers absolutely can. In fact, Christians engaged in spiritual warfare, ministry, intercession, or prophetic gifting often experience dragon dreams precisely because they're threatening Satan's kingdom. The enemy attacks those advancing God's purposes.

**Q: Should I rebuke the dream itself?**

No. The dream is revelation, not the enemy. Don't "rebuke" what God shows you. Instead, respond to what the dream reveals—rebuke the spiritual forces it exposes, not the messenger dream.

**Q: What if I keep having recurring dragon dreams?**

Recurring dreams signal:

- Unresolved spiritual issue needing attention
- Ongoing spiritual battle requiring persistent warfare
- Prophetic warning God is emphasizing
- Open door that hasn't been closed

Don't ignore recurring dragon dreams. Seek pastoral help, engage in focused prayer and fasting, and address whatever spiritual issue is indicated.

**Q: Can dragon dreams be from God if they're frightening?**

Yes. God sometimes uses disturbing imagery to get our attention, warn us, or reveal serious spiritual dynamics we'd otherwise miss. Fear in dreams isn't necessarily demonic—it may be appropriate awareness of spiritual danger. The key: does the dream ultimately point to God's sovereignty and victory, or leave you in hopeless fear?

**Q: Do dragon dreams mean I'm being attacked by Satan personally?**

Not necessarily Satan personally—he's not omnipresent and likely occupied with larger-scale deceptions. More likely, demonic forces under his command. Functionally, it's "satanic" in the sense of being from the enemy's kingdom, but probably executed by demons, not Satan himself.

## Conclusion: The Dragon's Defeat and Our Victory

Dragon dreams can terrify, confuse, or disturb. Yet Scripture offers ultimate comfort: **the dragon is already defeated.**

Revelation 20:10 prophesies: "And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur... to be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

Every dragon dream—however frightening—points toward this certain end. The dragon rages because his time is short (Revelation 12:12). He fights because he's losing. He deceives because truth defeats him.

**When dragons invade your dreams, remember:**

**You're on the winning side.** Christ triumphed at the cross (Colossians 2:15). Dragon dreams may show battles, but the war's outcome is certain.

**Greater is He in you.** The Holy Spirit within you exceeds any spiritual enemy's power (1 John 4:4).

**You have authority.** Jesus gave believers authority to trample on serpents and scorpions and to overcome all the enemy's power (Luke 10:19).

**The dragon will be bound.** Revelation 20:2-3 shows Satan bound for a thousand years, then ultimately thrown into the lake of fire. His defeat is assured.

**Victory belongs to those who overcome by Christ's blood.** Revelation 12:11 promises: "They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death."

As you encounter dragons in dreams, may you stand firm in Christ's victory, fight with His authority, and rest in His certain triumph. The dragon may roar—but the Lion of Judah has already won.
