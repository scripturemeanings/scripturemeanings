heroAlt: Goliath the giant warrior - the biblical champion defeated by David, demonstrating spiritual warfare principles
---

The story of David and Goliath is one of the most famous in all of Scripture—a teenage shepherd with a sling defeating a nine-foot warrior in bronze armor. But beneath the surface of this familiar narrative lies a profound spiritual battle that echoes the ancient conflict between [the Nephilim giants](/nephilim-giants-bible-meaning) and God's people, revealing timeless principles for defeating the giants we face today.

Goliath wasn't just a tall soldier. He was the last representative of an ancient bloodline of giants who had opposed God's purposes since before the Flood. His defeat by David marked a turning point in Israel's history and demonstrated spiritual warfare principles that remain relevant for believers facing seemingly impossible challenges.

## The Biblical Account: More Than Just a Story

The account of David and Goliath in 1 Samuel 17 is packed with details that reveal the spiritual significance of this confrontation:

> *"A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span. He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him."* (1 Samuel 17:4-7, NIV)

### Goliath's Imposing Specifications

Let's break down exactly what Israel faced:

**Height: "Six cubits and a span"**

- Masoretic Text: Approximately 9 feet 9 inches (6 cubits = 9 feet, 1 span = 9 inches)

- Septuagint/Dead Sea Scrolls (4QSam^a): Approximately 6 feet 9 inches (4 cubits and a span)

- Either measurement made him extraordinarily tall by ancient standards

**Armor weight: 5,000 shekels of bronze**

- Approximately 125 pounds (57 kg) of bronze armor

- Most soldiers couldn't even stand under this weight

- Demonstrated superhuman strength just to move

**Spear point: 600 shekels**

- Approximately 15 pounds (7 kg) of iron

- The shaft was "like a weaver's rod"—thick as a loom beam

- Normal soldiers couldn't throw such a weapon

**Additional equipment:**

- Bronze helmet

- Bronze greaves (leg armor)

- Bronze javelin on his back

- Shield bearer walking ahead (the shield itself too heavy to carry while armed)

The description emphasizes bronze (mentioned 5 times) and iron, the strongest metals of the era. Goliath was effectively a walking tank—an ancient equivalent of heavy armor.

### Forty Days of Defiance

> *"For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand."* (1 Samuel 17:16, NIV)

**Why forty days?**

The number forty carries spiritual significance throughout Scripture:

- Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:18)

- Israel wandered 40 years in the wilderness (Numbers 14:33-34)

- Jesus fasted 40 days before His ministry began (Matthew 4:2)

- Jesus appeared 40 days after resurrection (Acts 1:3)

Forty represents a period of **testing, trial, and preparation** for transformation. Goliath's forty days of mockery tested Israel's faith—would they trust God or succumb to fear?

### The Taunt: More Than an Insult

Goliath's challenge wasn't just battlefield bravado:

> *"This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other."* (1 Samuel 17:10, NIV)

The Hebrew word translated "defy" is **חָרַף (charaph)**, meaning "to reproach, scorn, or blaspheme." Goliath wasn't just challenging Israel's military might—he was **blaspheming Israel's God**.

His taunt implied:

- "Your God cannot save you"

- "Your God is weaker than Dagon" (the Philistine god)

- "Your covenant means nothing"

- "I am stronger than your deity"

This wasn't man versus man—it was a representative of ancient giant-bloodlines challenging the God of Israel.

## Goliath's Ancestry: The Nephilim Connection

Goliath didn't appear out of nowhere. He represented the last remnants of the giant clans that Israel had been commanded to destroy.

### From Gath: City of Giants

> *"A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp."* (1 Samuel 17:4, NIV)

**Gath** was one of the five Philistine cities and became known as a stronghold of giants. The biblical record shows:

**1. The Anakim Fled to Gath**

When Joshua conquered Canaan, giants from the Anakim clan fled to three Philistine cities:

> *"No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive."* (Joshua 11:22, NIV)

The Anakim were descendants of the Nephilim (Numbers 13:33), making Gath a refuge for giant-bloodlines.

**2. Gath's Reputation**

The Philistines utilized these giant warriors:

- Goliath from Gath (1 Samuel 17:4)

- Goliath's brother from Gath (1 Chronicles 20:5)

- A giant with six fingers and six toes from Gath (2 Samuel 21:20)

- Multiple "descendants of Rapha" in Gath (2 Samuel 21:22)

Gath became the Philistines' secret weapon—a city that bred and trained giant warriors.

### The Rephaim Connection

> *"These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."* (2 Samuel 21:22, NIV)

**Rapha** (or Rephaim) was one of the ancient giant clans. The Rephaim:

- Lived in Canaan before Israel (Genesis 14:5, 15:20)

- Were "as tall as the Anakites" (Deuteronomy 2:20-21)

- Included King Og of Bashan, whose iron bed measured 13.5 feet (Deuteronomy 3:11)

- Were associated with the spirits of the dead (Isaiah 26:14)

Goliath's lineage traced back to these ancient giants—the post-Flood remnants of the Nephilim bloodline.

### Why This Matters Spiritually

Goliath represented more than Philistine military power. He embodied:

**1. Ancient Rebellion**

His ancestry connected to [the Watchers' rebellion](/watchers-fallen-angels-meaning) and the corruption that necessitated the Flood.

**2. Ongoing Opposition**

Despite God's command to destroy the giant clans (Deuteronomy 7:2), they persisted—and now challenged Israel's king.

**3. Spiritual Warfare**

This wasn't just a physical battle but a continuation of the cosmic conflict between God's kingdom and the powers of darkness.

**4. The Seed War**

Genesis 3:15 prophesied ongoing conflict between the seed of the woman (ultimately Christ) and the seed of the serpent. Giant clans represented an attempt to corrupt and destroy the messianic line.

David, from the tribe of Judah (the line of the Messiah), defeating Goliath (from the giant-bloodlines) enacted this prophecy symbolically.

## David: An Unlikely Champion

The contrast between David and Goliath couldn't be more stark:

### David's Background

**Age**: Probably 15-17 years old (old enough to tend sheep alone, young enough to be called a "boy" - 1 Samuel 17:33)

**Occupation**: Shepherd (1 Samuel 17:34)

**Military experience**: None (Saul said, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man" - 1 Samuel 17:33)

**Physical stature**: Not mentioned, but implied to be unimpressive (Goliath "looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy" - 1 Samuel 17:42)

**Armor**: Refused Saul's armor because he hadn't tested it (1 Samuel 17:38-39)

**Weapons**: A staff, a sling, and five smooth stones (1 Samuel 17:40)

### Why David Was Qualified

Though young and inexperienced in human warfare, David possessed spiritual qualifications:

**1. Anointed by God**

Samuel had already anointed David as Israel's next king (1 Samuel 16:13). The Spirit of the Lord came upon him powerfully from that day forward.

**2. Experience with God's Deliverance**

> *"Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine."* (1 Samuel 17:36-37, NIV)

David had a testimony. He'd already experienced God's supernatural deliverance in life-threatening situations.

**3. Righteous Anger**

> *"Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"* (1 Samuel 17:26, NIV)

David wasn't motivated by fame or reward. He was indignant that God's name was being blasphemed.

**4. Confidence in God's Character**

> *"All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give all of you into our hands."* (1 Samuel 17:47, NIV)

David fought not in his own strength but in confidence that God would defend His own name.

### The Shepherd's Weapons

David chose weapons that seemed ridiculous against Goliath's armor:

**The Sling**

Far from a child's toy, the sling was a legitimate military weapon:

- Israelite slingers could "sling a stone at a hair and not miss" (Judges 20:16)

- Effective range: 200-400 meters

- Projectile velocity: 60-90 mph

- Impact force: Comparable to a modern handgun

**Five Smooth Stones**

David selected five stones from the brook (1 Samuel 17:40). Why five?

**Theory 1**: One for Goliath and four for his brothers

Later Scripture reveals Goliath had four brothers, all giants (2 Samuel 21:22). David may have prepared for the possibility of fighting multiple giants.

**Theory 2**: Backup stones

The first stone was all David needed, but a wise warrior brings extras in case the first shot misses or the sling breaks.

**Theory 3**: Symbolic completeness

Five represents grace in biblical numerology. David's victory would demonstrate God's grace, not human might.

## The Battle: Five Spiritual Warfare Principles

The confrontation between David and Goliath reveals timeless principles for defeating giants in our own lives:

### Principle 1: Giants Rely on Intimidation

> *"When the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear."* (1 Samuel 17:24, NIV)

**Goliath's Strategy:**

- Physical presence (9+ feet tall)

- Impressive armor (125 pounds of bronze)

- Verbal taunts (twice daily for 40 days)

- Reputation (champion warrior from a city of giants)

**The Goal**: Paralyze Israel with fear before fighting even began.

**Modern Application**: 

Spiritual giants (problems, addictions, fears, obstacles) often seem larger than life. Their size and reputation are weapons designed to make us surrender without fighting.

**David's Response**: He focused on God's size, not Goliath's:

> *"Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"* (1 Samuel 17:26, NIV)

**The Lesson**: Measure your giant against God, not against yourself.

### Principle 2: Past Victories Build Faith for Future Battles

> *"The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine."* (1 Samuel 17:37, NIV)

**David's Testimony:**

1. He'd killed a lion that attacked his flock

2. He'd killed a bear that attacked his flock

3. God had delivered him both times

4. Therefore, God would deliver him from Goliath

**Modern Application**:

Review your spiritual history. Where has God delivered you before? Those past victories aren't accidents—they're building blocks for future faith.

**The Lesson**: Your testimony is a weapon. Remember what God has done, and trust Him to do it again.

### Principle 3: Fight with What God Has Given You

> *"Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. 'I cannot go in these,' he said to Saul, 'because I am not used to them.' So he took them off."* (1 Samuel 17:38-39, NIV)

**Saul's Logic**: If you're fighting a warrior, dress like a warrior.

**David's Wisdom**: Don't adopt your enemy's methods or wear armor you haven't tested.

**The Contrast:**

- Saul offered **human weapons** (armor, sword) = **human strength**

- David chose **shepherd's weapons** (sling, stones) = **dependence on God**

**Modern Application**:

Don't fight spiritual battles with worldly weapons. Don't try to defeat sin with willpower alone, depression with positive thinking alone, or spiritual opposition with human wisdom alone.

**The Lesson**: God often uses what's already in your hand. Use the gifts, experiences, and anointing He's given you—don't copy someone else's armor.

### Principle 4: Run Toward the Giant

> *"As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him."* (1 Samuel 17:48, NIV)

**David didn't:**

- Wait for Goliath to reach him

- Run away in fear

- Hide behind Israel's army

- Approach tentatively

**David RAN toward the giant.**

**Why this matters:**

- **Momentum matters**: David's running added velocity to his stone's impact

- **Initiative matters**: Offense beats defense in spiritual warfare

- **Courage matters**: Running toward danger demonstrates faith, not foolishness

- **Timing matters**: David struck while Goliath was still approaching, before the giant could use his weapons

**Modern Application**:

Stop running from your giants. Face them. Confront them. Attack them before they attack you.

**The Lesson**: Faith advances. Fear retreats. The spiritual battle is won by those who run toward the fight, not away from it.

### Principle 5: Aim for the Head

> *"Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground."* (1 Samuel 17:49, NIV)

**The Only Vulnerable Spot**:

Goliath's entire body was protected by bronze armor except his face. David's stone struck the one place that wasn't covered—and struck with such force that it "sank into his forehead."

**The Fatal Blow**:

> *"David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword."* (1 Samuel 17:51, NIV)

David ensured Goliath was dead by decapitating him with the giant's own sword.

**Spiritual Significance**:

- **The head represents**: Authority, control, mindset, the source of commands

- **Cutting off the head**: Removing authority, stopping commands, ending the threat permanently

**Modern Application**:

Don't just wound your giants—kill them. Identify the source of the problem (the "head") and strike there:

- Addiction? Cut off access at the source

- Fear? Renew your mind with truth

- Sin pattern? Eliminate the trigger

**The Lesson**: Finish the battle. Wounded giants can recover. Dead giants can't.

## Goliath's Brothers: The Battle Continued

Defeating Goliath didn't end the giant problem. His brothers continued fighting Israel:

### Four More Giants from Gath

**1. Ishbi-Benob** (2 Samuel 21:16-17)

- Armed with a new sword

- Spear weighing 300 shekels of bronze (7.5 pounds)

- Tried to kill David when David was exhausted

- Killed by Abishai son of Zeruiah

**2. Saph/Sippai** (2 Samuel 21:18, 1 Chronicles 20:4)

- Another descendant of Rapha

- Killed by Sibbeken the Hushathite

**3. Lahmi, Brother of Goliath** (1 Chronicles 20:5)

- Explicitly called "the brother of Goliath the Gittite"

- Spear shaft "like a weaver's rod" (same description as Goliath's)

- Killed by Elhanan son of Jair

**4. Unnamed Giant with Extra Digits** (2 Samuel 21:20-21)

- Six fingers on each hand, six toes on each foot (24 total digits)

- Described as "huge" and a descendant of Rapha

- Taunted Israel like Goliath had

- Killed by Jonathan son of Shimea (David's brother)

### The Complete Victory

> *"These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."* (2 Samuel 21:22, NIV)

**The Pattern:**

1. David killed the first giant (Goliath)

2. David's men killed the remaining giants

3. The giant bloodline from Gath was finally eliminated

**Spiritual Lessons:**

**Giants have relatives**: Defeating one problem often reveals related problems. Conquering Goliath (the main giant) led to facing his brothers (related issues).

**Leadership matters**: David's victory inspired his men. When leaders demonstrate faith, others are emboldened.

**Complete victory requires persistence**: Israel finally eliminated the Gath giants after multiple battles, not just one.

## Why This Battle Still Matters

The story of David and Goliath resonates across millennia because it addresses universal human experiences:

### 1. Everyone Faces Giants

Your giant might not be nine feet tall, but you face overwhelming challenges:

- **Financial giants**: Debt, job loss, economic pressure

- **Health giants**: Disease, chronic pain, mental illness

- **Relational giants**: Broken marriage, rebellious children, toxic friendships

- **Spiritual giants**: Besetting sins, doubt, spiritual oppression

- **Emotional giants**: Fear, anxiety, depression, trauma

- **Circumstantial giants**: Legal battles, injustice, systemic obstacles

Like Israel, you can let giants intimidate you into paralysis, or you can face them with God's help.

### 2. The Battle Belongs to the Lord

> *"All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give all of you into our hands."* (1 Samuel 17:47, NIV)

**David's Confidence:**

- Not in his skill with a sling

- Not in his physical strength

- Not in his strategy

- But in God's character and covenant faithfulness

**The Principle**: We fight from a position of victory (what Christ has already accomplished), not for victory (trying to earn God's help).

### 3. God Chooses Unlikely Champions

David was:

- The youngest of eight brothers (1 Samuel 16:11)

- A shepherd, not a soldier

- Unimpressive in appearance (1 Samuel 16:7)

- Overlooked by his own family (1 Samuel 16:11)

- Too young for military service (1 Samuel 17:33)

Yet God chose him to:

- Kill Goliath

- Become Israel's greatest king

- Write much of the Psalms

- Be in the messianic line (Matthew 1:6)

**The Lesson**: God doesn't choose the qualified; He qualifies the chosen. Your weakness highlights His strength (2 Corinthians 12:9).

### 4. One Victory Can Change Everything

**Before David's Victory:**

- Israel was paralyzed by fear (1 Samuel 17:11)

- Goliath defied God daily (1 Samuel 17:16)

- The Philistines threatened Israel's existence (1 Samuel 17:3)

- Saul was a failed king hiding in his tent (1 Samuel 17:11)

**After David's Victory:**

- Israel routed the Philistines (1 Samuel 17:52)

- David became a national hero (1 Samuel 18:7)

- The Philistine threat was eliminated for a generation

- David's path to kingship accelerated (1 Samuel 18:5)

**The Lesson**: One moment of faith-filled obedience can transform your entire future. Your Goliath moment is a hinge point—step through it in faith.

### 5. Giants Connect to Deeper Spiritual Realities

Goliath represented more than a military challenge. His lineage traced to [the Nephilim giants](/nephilim-giants-bible-meaning), whose origin involved [the Watchers' rebellion at Mount Hermon](/mount-hermon-bible-meaning). This ancient corruption persisted through giant clans until heroes like David eliminated them.

**The Cosmic Conflict:**

- Genesis 3:15: Serpent's seed versus woman's seed

- Giants represented opposition to God's kingdom

- David (from Judah, the messianic line) defeating Goliath (from giant-bloodlines) enacted this prophecy

**The Ultimate Victory**: Jesus Christ, the ultimate Son of David, defeated all spiritual giants through His death and resurrection:

- Sin (Romans 6:23)

- Death (1 Corinthians 15:55)

- Satan (Colossians 2:15)

- Demons (Luke 10:17-20)

- The world system (John 16:33)

David's victory over Goliath foreshadowed Christ's victory over all God's enemies.

## Practical Applications: Defeating Your Giants Today

How do we apply David's victory to modern spiritual warfare?

### Step 1: Identify Your Giant

**Ask yourself:**

- What intimidates me most right now?

- What challenge makes me want to hide like Israel in their tents?

- What voice taunts me daily with lies about God's inability to help?

- What problem seems impossible without supernatural intervention?

**Name it specifically**: "Crushing debt," "cancer diagnosis," "crumbling marriage," "pornography addiction"—whatever it is, define it clearly.

### Step 2: Remember Your Testimony

**Reflect on:**

- Where has God delivered you before?

- What "lions and bears" has He helped you defeat?

- When have you seen His faithfulness in smaller battles?

**Write it down**: Keep a record of God's faithfulness. Your testimony is ammunition for future battles.

### Step 3: Refuse the Wrong Armor

**Identify false solutions:**

- What worldly methods are you tempted to use?

- Whose "armor" are people offering you that doesn't fit?

- What strategies seem right but don't align with God's ways?

**Strip off:**

- Self-reliance

- Worldly wisdom

- Manipulation

- Fear-driven decisions

- Human strength alone

**Put on** (Ephesians 6:10-18):

- Belt of truth

- Breastplate of righteousness

- Shoes of gospel of peace

- Shield of faith

- Helmet of salvation

- Sword of the Spirit

### Step 4: Use What God Has Given You

**Ask:**

- What gifts has God given me?

- What experiences have prepared me?

- What spiritual weapons do I know how to use?

- What's already "in my hand" like David's sling?

**Common spiritual weapons:**

- Prayer and fasting

- Scripture memorization and declaration

- Worship

- Testimony

- Christian community

- Accountability

- Professional help when appropriate

- The authority of Jesus's name

### Step 5: Run Toward the Battle

**Take offensive action:**

- Stop avoiding the giant

- Face the problem directly

- Take the first step while afraid

- Don't wait for feelings to change—move in faith

**Remember**: Courage isn't the absence of fear; it's obedience despite fear.

### Step 6: Aim for the Head

**Find the source:**

- What's the root cause, not just symptoms?

- What feeds this giant?

- What gives it authority in my life?

- What needs to be cut off permanently?

**Strike decisively**: Half-measures don't kill giants. Complete obedience, radical commitment, and thorough repentance eliminate spiritual enemies.

### Step 7: Finish the Battle

**Don't stop until:**

- The giant is truly dead

- You've cut off its head (removed its authority)

- You've taken the spoils (claimed the victory)

- You've inspired others by your testimony

**Beware**: Wounded giants can recover. Ensure complete victory.

## Conclusion: The Shepherd Becomes the King

David entered the Valley of Elah as a shepherd boy carrying his lunch to his brothers. He left as Israel's champion and began his journey to the throne.

**The progression:**

1. Shepherd of sheep → Shepherd of Israel

2. Fighting lions and bears → Fighting giants and armies

3. Protecting his father's flock → Protecting God's people

4. Chosen by God in private (1 Samuel 16) → Revealed by God in public (1 Samuel 17)

5. Anointed as future king → Acting like the present king

**The principle**: Faithfulness in small battles prepares you for great victories. How you handle your lion and bear determines whether you're ready for your Goliath.

### Your Giant Is Not Your End

Whatever giant stands before you, taunting you, defying the living God—it's not the end of your story. It's the beginning of your testimony.

Israel watched Goliath for forty days and saw an insurmountable obstacle. David saw an opportunity to magnify God's name. The difference wasn't their circumstances but their perspective.

**Your giant is:**

- Not bigger than your God

- Not stronger than your testimony

- Not capable of stopping God's purposes

- Already defeated in Christ

The giant clans that survived the Flood, that opposed Israel's conquest, that threatened David's generation—they're all gone now. Goliath's line ended. But David's line continues: **Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the King of Kings**.

And if you're in Christ, you're in the line of giant-killers.

So pick up your stones. Remember your testimony. Reject the wrong armor. Run toward your battle. Aim for the head. And watch your giant fall.

Because the battle isn't yours—it's the Lord's. And He's already won.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How tall was Goliath really?**

The Masoretic text says "six cubits and a span" (approximately 9 feet 9 inches), while the Septuagint and Dead Sea Scrolls say "four cubits and a span" (approximately 6 feet 9 inches). Both measurements made him exceptionally tall. The exact height matters less than what he represented: an intimidating giant from the Nephilim bloodline.

**Q: Why didn't the Israelite soldiers fight Goliath?**

Fear paralyzed them (1 Samuel 17:11, 24). Even King Saul, who was taller than his soldiers (1 Samuel 9:2), refused to fight. They focused on Goliath's size rather than God's power. Only David, fresh from experiencing God's deliverance from lions and bears, had the faith to act.

**Q: Was David's victory just luck or skill?**

Neither—it was faith. David had skill with a sling (Judges 20:16 shows Israelite slingers were highly accurate), but he attributed victory to God, not his ability (1 Samuel 17:37, 45-47). His confidence came from knowing God would defend His own name, not from trusting his marksmanship.

**Q: Why did David take five stones if he only needed one?**

Three theories: (1) Goliath had four brothers (2 Samuel 21:22), so David prepared for multiple giants; (2) wise warriors bring backup ammunition; (3) five represents grace in biblical numerology, symbolizing God's gracious intervention. The text doesn't specify, but all three align with David's character.

**Q: What happened to Goliath's sword?**

After killing Goliath, David took his sword (1 Samuel 17:51). Later, when fleeing from Saul, David asked the priest Ahimelech for weapons. Ahimelech gave him Goliath's sword, wrapped in cloth behind the ephod (1 Samuel 21:8-9). David kept it as a trophy of God's deliverance.

**Q: Did Goliath's brothers try to avenge him?**

Yes! 2 Samuel 21 records four more giants from Gath who fought Israel, including Lahmi, explicitly called "the brother of Goliath" (1 Chronicles 20:5). All were killed by David's warriors. The giant bloodline from Gath was finally eliminated through these battles.

**Q: How does David's victory relate to spiritual warfare today?**

David's principles apply to any overwhelming challenge: (1) Focus on God's size, not the problem's size; (2) Remember past victories; (3) Fight with spiritual weapons, not worldly ones; (4) Run toward battles, not away from them; (5) Strike at the source; (6) Finish what you start. These timeless truths defeat giants in any era.
