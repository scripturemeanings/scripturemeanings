*Government disclosure of UFO/UAP phenomena is accelerating. When full "alien contact" is announced, most of the world will be unprepared. Christians shouldn't be among them.*

---

We're watching it happen in real time.

**2004:** The USS Nimitz incident—military pilots encounter UFO with impossible capabilities.

**2017:** Pentagon confirms three Navy UFO videos are authentic "unidentified aerial phenomena."

**2020:** U.S. Department of Defense establishes UFO task force.

**2021:** Director of National Intelligence releases UAP report confirming 144 military encounters.

**2022:** NASA forms independent UAP study team.

**2023:** Congress holds public hearings on UFOs with military whistleblowers testifying under oath.

**2024-2025:** Disclosure momentum accelerates—mainstream media normalizing the topic, government officials openly discussing "non-human intelligence," preparation for potential contact increasing.

**The pattern is unmistakable: systematic preparation of humanity for "alien disclosure."**

This isn't conspiracy theory. It's documented, public, official government activity preparing the world to accept that we're not alone—that "advanced beings" exist and have been interacting with humanity.

**When full disclosure comes—and it will—the world will face the greatest deception in human history.**

Most people will believe the lie. They'll accept the "alien" explanation. They'll embrace the new paradigm. They'll follow where these entities lead.

**Christians who understand the biblical framework won't be deceived. But only if we're prepared.**

This article equips you for what's coming. Not speculation—biblical preparation for prophesied events now unfolding.

## Why Disclosure Is Inevitable

The momentum toward full "alien disclosure" isn't slowing—it's accelerating. Multiple factors converge, making public acknowledgment of "non-human intelligence" not just likely, but inevitable.

### Government Acknowledgment Is Already Happening

**The shift is remarkable:**

**Before 2017:** UFOs were taboo, ridiculed, dismissed. Government denied, deflected, discredited witnesses.

**After 2017:** Pentagon confirms UFO videos authentic. Military pilots speak openly. Congressional hearings occur. Official task forces formed.

**This isn't accidental—it's coordinated preparation.**

The government doesn't suddenly reverse 70+ years of denial without purpose. They're conditioning the public, normalizing the topic, preparing for larger revelation.

### Military and Intelligence Whistleblowers Are Speaking

**Recent testimony includes:**

**David Grusch (2023):** Former intelligence official testifies under oath that U.S. has retrieved non-human spacecraft and biological remains. Claims multi-decade crash retrieval program exists.

**Commander David Fravor (2017-present):** Navy pilot describes Tic-Tac UFO encounter—technology defying physics, no propulsion, instant acceleration.

**Luis Elizondo (2017-present):** Former Pentagon UFO program director confirms government investigation of craft with capabilities beyond known technology.

**These aren't fringe figures—they're credible military and intelligence professionals risking careers to speak.**

### Mainstream Media Has Shifted Dramatically

**The tone change is undeniable:**

**Previously:** UFO reports mocked, witnesses ridiculed, topic relegated to tabloids.

**Now:** New York Times, Washington Post, 60 Minutes, major networks report seriously. "UAP" replaces "UFO" (sounds more scientific). Experts discuss openly. Stigma removed.

**This normalized discussion prepares mass consciousness for acceptance.**

### Scientific Community Is Engaging

NASA formed independent UAP study team (2022). Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb searches for extraterrestrial technology. Academic papers discuss "technosignatures." Scientific American, Nature publish articles.

**Science lending credibility prepares educated skeptics to accept "alien" explanation.**

### Global Coordination Suggests Planned Event

Multiple governments acknowledging UFOs simultaneously:

- United States (most public)

- United Kingdom (declassified files)

- France (GEIPAN investigation program)

- Brazil (official investigations)

- Japan (revised protocols for encounters)

- Others following

**Coordinated global disclosure suggests preparation for worldwide revelation event.**

### The Technology "Solves" Humanity's Problems

The promised benefits drive acceptance:

**"Aliens offer solutions to:"**

- Climate change (clean energy technology)

- Disease (advanced medical knowledge)

- War (consciousness evolution)

- Poverty (abundance technology)

- Death (extended lifespan, consciousness transfer)

**People desperate for solutions will accept entities offering them—exactly as Genesis 6 Watchers presented forbidden knowledge as beneficial.**

**Disclosure isn't coming—it's already underway. We're watching the final stages before open contact.**

## What Full Disclosure Will Look Like

Based on current trajectory, biblical prophecy, and the established pattern, we can anticipate what full "alien disclosure" will involve.

### Stage 1: Official Government Announcement (Likely Soon)

**"We are not alone."**

The announcement could come from:

- Joint statement from multiple governments

- United Nations special session

- Presidential/Prime Ministerial address

- Emergency broadcast following dramatic incident

**The message:**

- "Non-human intelligence" has been interacting with humanity

- Government knew but kept secret "for our protection"

- Time for humanity to join "galactic community"

- These beings are benevolent, advanced, here to help

- Must overcome fear and embrace this new reality

**Public reaction will be mixed:**

- Mass excitement ("we're not alone!")

- Religious crisis (challenges core beliefs)

- Fear (what do they want?)

- Acceptance (media prepared us, expected this)

- Denial (can't be real)

**But mainstream narrative will push acceptance: "This is humanity's next evolutionary step."**

### Stage 2: Presentation of "Aliens" and Their Message

Following announcement, entities will present themselves—likely initially through media, then possibly in person.

**Their presentation will include:**

**Appearance:** Probably "greys" initially (familiar from pop culture), possibly other forms. Non-threatening. "Peaceful."

**Message emphasizing:**

- They've guided humanity throughout history

- Ancient civilizations knew them (ancient alien theory)

- Religions misunderstood their visits (gods were aliens)

- Humanity ready now for truth

- Must evolve consciousness to join them

- They'll help us solve problems (climate, disease, war)

- Earth at critical juncture—they're here to assist

**Technology demonstration:**

- Advanced capabilities beyond our science

- Healing technology

- Energy solutions

- Proof they're more advanced

**Their gospel will directly contradict Scripture:**

- No Creator God (universe evolved)

- Jesus was enlightened alien/hybrid (not God)

- Multiple paths to ascension (not salvation through Christ alone)

- Humanity is divine (not fallen/sinful)

- Evolution not creation

- Death is transition not judgment

- Consciousness is eternal (no heaven/hell/judgment)

**This is 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11's "strong delusion" in action.**

### Stage 3: Integration and "The Change"

After disclosure and contact, rapid integration begins:

**Government/Political:**

- UN recognizes "alien" representatives

- Treaties established

- Global governance structures formed ("we must unite")

- National sovereignty diminished

- Preparation for world government (Revelation 13)

**Religious/Spiritual:**

- Interfaith unity pushed ("all religions were about them")

- Biblical Christianity marginalized ("primitive, pre-contact belief")

- Persecution of believers who reject "alien gospel"

- New "cosmic" spirituality becomes official

**Technological:**

- "Alien" technology shared (with strings attached)

- Genetic enhancement offered ("upgrade" humanity)

- Consciousness technology (mind control)

- Mark of the Beast infrastructure (Revelation 13:16-17)

**Social:**

- Hybrid humans openly integrated (Dr. David Jacobs' "The Change")

- Society restructured around "cosmic citizenship"

- Those refusing integration ostracized

- "Evolved" vs "primitive" humans

**This creates conditions for Antichrist to rise as bridge between humanity and "aliens."**

### Stage 4: The Great Deception Peaks

**Full integration produces:**

- Most of humanity accepting "alien gospel"

- Biblical Christianity seen as obstacle to progress

- Persecution of believers intensifying

- Mark of the Beast mandatory for participation

- Antichrist revealed as "human representative" to cosmic beings

- Strong delusion complete—most can't see truth

- Tribulation conditions fully manifested

**This fulfills:**

- Matthew 24:24 (signs and wonders deceive many)

- 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 (strong delusion, accepting the lie)

- Revelation 13 (mark, worship, persecution)

- Matthew 24:37 (days of Noah repeating)

**Christians who prepared biblically will recognize the deception. Those who didn't will be vulnerable.**

## What Christians Need to Know

To withstand this deception, believers must understand key truths now—before the pressure intensifies.

### Know These Entities Are Demons, Not Aliens

**Core truth:** There are no extraterrestrials. These entities are:

- Fallen angels (still embodied)

- Demons (disembodied Nephilim spirits)

- Manifesting through interdimensional technology

- Following Satan's end-times strategy

**Biblical evidence:**

- Genesis 6 (the original pattern)

- Jude 6 (angels sinned, bound until judgment)

- Ephesians 6:12 (spiritual forces in heavenly places)

- Matthew 24:37 (days of Noah repeating)

- 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11 (Satan's deception with signs/wonders)

**They're not from space—they're from spiritual dimensions presenting themselves as aliens to deceive.**

### Understand Their Message Contradicts All Essential Christian Doctrine

**The "alien gospel" systematically denies:**

**1. God as Creator**

- Bible: God created universe (Genesis 1)

- "Aliens": Universe evolved, they seeded life

**2. Humans Made in God's Image**

- Bible: Humanity specially created (Genesis 1:27)

- "Aliens": Humans are experiments/genetic projects

**3. Sin and Fall**

- Bible: Humanity fell through sin (Genesis 3)

- "Aliens": Humanity simply unevolved, needs upgrade

**4. Christ's Deity**

- Bible: Jesus is God in flesh (John 1:1,14)

- "Aliens": Jesus was enlightened alien or hybrid

**5. Salvation Through Christ Alone**

- Bible: No other name for salvation (Acts 4:12)

- "Aliens": Many paths, consciousness evolution

**6. Judgment Coming**

- Bible: Christ returns in judgment (Revelation 19)

- "Aliens": Humanity joins cosmic community peacefully

**7. Scripture as God's Word**

- Bible: Scripture inspired, authoritative (2 Timothy 3:16)

- "Aliens": Scripture misunderstood, pre-contact mythology

**Any teaching denying these core truths is false—regardless of signs, wonders, or advanced technology.**

### Recognize That Technology Doesn't Equal Truth

**The deception uses advanced capabilities to prove credibility:**

"They have technology beyond ours, so they must know truth."

**But technology proves nothing about theology:**

- Satan has supernatural power (Job 1:16,19)

- Magicians in Egypt duplicated Moses' miracles (Exodus 7:11-12)

- Antichrist will perform signs and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9)

- False prophets work miracles (Revelation 13:13-14)

**Advanced technology + false doctrine = demonic deception, not enlightened truth.**

**Matthew 24:24:**

> "For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect."

**The "if possible" indicates believers can resist—but only if grounded in truth before deception intensifies.**

### Accept That Most People Will Be Deceived

**This is hard truth, but Scripture is clear:**

**Matthew 7:13-14:**

> "Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."

**2 Thessalonians 2:10-12:**

> "...and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness."

**Most of humanity will:**

- Accept the "alien" explanation

- Believe the false gospel

- Reject biblical truth as primitive

- Embrace the deception eagerly

- Follow Antichrist when he appears

- Take the mark of the beast

- Persecute those who resist

**This includes:**

- Family members

- Friends

- Coworkers

- Neighbors

- Fellow church members who weren't grounded

**Prepare emotionally: you may stand alone or with few others. That's normal for truth in deceptive times.**

### Remember Christ Has Already Won

**The outcome isn't in doubt:**

**Colossians 2:15:**

> "He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him."

Christ defeated these powers at the cross. Their current activity is death throes, not victory march.

**Revelation 19:11-16:**

> "Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war... From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations... On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords."

**Christ returns. Defeats all enemies. Establishes His kingdom. The "aliens," Antichrist, false prophet—all judged and destroyed.**

**Knowing the end helps us endure the middle.**

## How to Prepare Spiritually

Spiritual preparation is most critical. These practical steps build foundation to withstand deception.

### 1. Ground Yourself in Scripture Now

**Before deception intensifies, establish unshakeable biblical foundation:**

**Daily Bible reading:**

- Systematic plan covering whole Bible

- Focus on Genesis 1-11 (creation, Fall, Flood)

- Study end-times passages (Matthew 24, Revelation, 2 Thessalonians)

- Understand core doctrines (creation, sin, salvation, judgment)

**Memorize key verses:**

- John 1:1-3 (Christ as Creator)

- Acts 4:12 (salvation through Christ alone)

- 1 John 4:1-3 (test spirits by Christ's incarnation)

- 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 (strong delusion warning)

- Matthew 24:24 (false signs and wonders)

**Study this biblical framework thoroughly:**

- Genesis 6 (Watchers, Nephilim, corruption)

- 1 Enoch (context for Genesis 6)

- Jude 6, 2 Peter 2:4-5 (angels' sin and judgment)

- Matthew 24:37 (days of Noah repeating)

**Why now:** Once deception reaches full strength, clear thinking becomes difficult. Ground yourself in truth while you can think clearly.

### 2. Cultivate Intimacy with God

**Relationship with God, not just knowledge about God, sustains faith under pressure.**

**Daily prayer:**

- Not ritual—real conversation

- Pour out heart honestly

- Listen for His voice (through Scripture)

- Pray for discernment, protection, steadfastness

**Worship:**

- Focus on who God is

- Praise His character, works, promises

- Build confidence in His sovereignty

- Remember His faithfulness

**Obedience:**

- Practice immediate obedience to known truth

- Repent quickly when you fail

- Walk in holiness daily

- Build habit of surrender

**Quiet with God:**

- Silence before Him regularly

- Meditate on Scripture

- Allow Holy Spirit to teach

- Develop sensitivity to His leading

**Why critical:** When voices multiply and confusion increases, intimate knowledge of God's voice helps you distinguish truth from deception.

### 3. Engage in Spiritual Warfare Now

**Don't wait until battle is critical—practice warfare before it intensifies.**

**Put on full armor daily (Ephesians 6:10-18):**

- Belt of truth (know and speak truth)

- Breastplate of righteousness (live in holiness)

- Gospel shoes (ready to witness)

- Shield of faith (trust God, not circumstances)

- Helmet of salvation (secure in identity)

- Sword of Spirit (wield Scripture effectively)

- Prayer (constant communication)

**Practice spiritual authority:**

- Resist devil—he flees (James 4:7)

- Command demons in Jesus' name (Mark 16:17)

- Plead Christ's blood (Revelation 12:11)

- Destroy arguments raised against God (2 Corinthians 10:4-5)

**Fast and pray:**

- Builds spiritual muscle

- Increases sensitivity to Spirit

- Breaks strongholds

- Prepares for battles ahead

**Why essential:** The coming deception is spiritual warfare on unprecedented scale. Warriors trained beforehand survive battles better than untrained soldiers.

### 4. Fellowship with Like-Minded Believers

**Isolation makes you vulnerable. Community provides strength.**

**Find believers who:**

- Take Scripture seriously

- Understand end-times biblically

- Recognize UFO phenomena as spiritual warfare

- Will stand firm regardless of cost

- Encourage biblical faithfulness

**Meet regularly:**

- Study Scripture together

- Pray together

- Encourage one another

- Share resources

- Plan mutual support

**Build accountability:**

- Honest about struggles

- Open to correction

- Transparent about temptations

- Committed to helping each other stand

**Hebrews 10:24-25:**

> "And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near."

**Why necessary:** Persecution often isolates believers. Community built now provides refuge when isolation threatens.

### 5. Prepare to Be Misunderstood and Opposed

**Mental preparation reduces shock when opposition comes.**

**Expect:**

- Family thinking you're crazy

- Friends distancing themselves

- Church members rejecting this understanding

- Coworkers mocking

- Culture calling you conspiracy theorist

- Eventually: persecution, marginalization, potential arrest

**Remember:**

- Noah was mocked—he built anyway

- Prophets were rejected—they spoke anyway

- Jesus was called demon-possessed—He taught anyway

- Apostles were persecuted—they witnessed anyway

**1 Peter 4:12-14:**

> "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."

**Mental preparation now prevents discouragement later.**

## How to Prepare Practically

Practical preparation complements spiritual foundation. Wise stewardship prepares for potential difficulties.

### 1. Reduce Dependence on Systems That May Require Compliance

**When mark of the beast becomes mandatory for participation (Revelation 13:16-17), those dependent on the system face impossible choices.**

**Steps to reduce dependence:**

**Financial:**

- Reduce debt aggressively

- Build emergency savings (6+ months expenses)

- Consider tangible assets (not just digital)

- Diversify income sources

- Learn valuable skills for barter economy

**Food/Water:**

- Build food storage (3-6 months minimum)

- Water purification capability

- Basic gardening knowledge

- Food preservation skills

- Share resources with prepared community

**Medical:**

- Stock essential medications (legally)

- First aid training

- Natural/alternative medicine knowledge

- Build health now through good habits

**Why important:** Refusing mark of the beast may mean exclusion from commerce (Revelation 13:17). Preparation reduces desperation that leads to compromise.

### 2. Develop Self-Sufficiency Skills

**Skills retain value regardless of economic/social conditions:**

**Food production:**

- Gardening/farming

- Animal husbandry

- Food preservation (canning, drying, fermenting)

- Wild food foraging

- Seed saving

**Basic trades:**

- Carpentry

- Plumbing

- Electrical

- Mechanics

- Sewing/tailoring

**Survival skills:**

- Fire making

- Shelter building

- Water sourcing/purification

- Navigation

- First aid

**Why valuable:** These skills provide for family, serve community, enable you to help others while remaining independent of systems requiring compromise.

### 3. Build Community of Prepared Believers

**Individual preparation has limits. Community multiplies capabilities.**

**Organized community can:**

- Pool resources

- Share skills

- Provide mutual protection

- Care for weak/vulnerable

- Worship together despite restrictions

- Evangelize despite persecution

- Preserve biblical teaching

**Historical parallel:** Early church during Roman persecution. They met in homes, shared resources, cared for each other, stood firm despite opposition—and grew.

**Start now:**

- Identify like-minded believers

- Meet regularly (start small groups)

- Discuss practical preparation

- Share skills and resources

- Plan mutual support scenarios

- Build trust before crisis demands it

**Why critical:** Lone individuals fall easier than committed communities. Acts 2:42-47 describes early church community—that model may be needed again.

### 4. Document and Share Your Testimony

**Record why you believe what you believe while thinking clearly.**

**Write out:**

- Your testimony (how you came to faith)

- Why you trust Scripture

- Biblical evidence for this framework

- How you recognized the deception

- Your commitment to stand regardless of cost

**Share with:**

- Family (even if they don't understand now)

- Friends (plant seeds)

- Church (those who'll listen)

- Online (blog, video, social media)

**Why important:** 

- Clarifies your own thinking

- Creates record if you're silenced

- May help others later who remember

- Testimony is powerful weapon (Revelation 12:11)

### 5. Stay Informed But Don't Obsess

**Balance awareness with peace.**

**Do:**

- Monitor disclosure developments

- Understand current trajectory

- Recognize prophetic fulfillment

- Stay informed about persecution patterns

**Don't:**

- Obsess over every news story

- Let fear dominate thoughts

- Neglect present responsibilities

- Become paranoid or extremist

- Let this replace gospel focus

**Luke 21:28:**

> "Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."

**Prophetic signs should encourage us (redemption near), not terrify us. Balanced awareness, grounded peace.**

## When Disclosure Happens: Your Response Plan

When official disclosure occurs, you'll face immediate decisions. Plan now so you respond biblically, not reactively.

### Immediate Actions (First 24-48 Hours)

## The Ultimate Preparation: Know Christ Personally

All practical preparation fails if you don't know Christ personally.

**If you're reading this and have never trusted Christ:**

You face deception far greater than you realize. The coming "alien" disclosure is preparation for history's greatest lie. Most people will believe it.

**But you don't have to.**

**The truth:**

- God created you in His image

- You've sinned against Him

- Sin separates you from God

- You cannot save yourself

- God loves you anyway

- Jesus Christ (God in flesh) died for your sins

- He rose from death, defeating death itself

- He offers you forgiveness, new life, eternal salvation

- You must trust Him alone for salvation

**Romans 10:9:**

> "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

**No other way. Not aliens. Not consciousness evolution. Not good works. Not religion. Only Christ.**

**If you want salvation:**

Pray honestly to God:

"God, I know I'm a sinner. I know I can't save myself. I believe Jesus is Your Son. I believe He died for my sins and rose from death. I trust Him alone for salvation. Forgive me. Save me. Make me Yours. I surrender my life to You. Amen."

**If you prayed that genuinely, you're saved. Now:**

- Tell someone

- Read the Bible (start with Gospel of John)

- Find a Bible-believing church

- Begin following Christ

- Prepare for what's coming

## Conclusion: Stand Firm in the Truth

The coming "alien" disclosure will be the most sophisticated deception in human history. Advanced technology, coordinated global governments, unified media messaging, supernatural signs and wonders—all designed to convince humanity to accept the lie.

**Most people will believe it.**

**You don't have to.**

**You're prepared now. You understand:**

- These entities are demons, not aliens

- This is Genesis 6 repeating, not first contact

- Their message contradicts core Christian doctrine

- Technology doesn't validate theology

- Most people will be deceived

- Christ has already won

- Your redemption draws near

**You know how to prepare:**

**Spiritually:**

- Ground yourself in Scripture

- Cultivate intimacy with God

- Engage in spiritual warfare

- Fellowship with believers

- Prepare for opposition

**Practically:**

- Reduce system dependence

- Develop useful skills

- Build prepared community

- Document your testimony

- Stay informed but peaceful

**You have a response plan:**

- Turn off media initially

- Gather with believers

- Reaffirm truth

- Protect family

- Minister to confused

- Witness to lost

- Stand firm regardless

**When disclosure comes, you won't be surprised. You'll be ready.**

**Most importantly, you know Christ. And that's enough.**

**2 Timothy 1:12:**

> "But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me."

**The deception is coming. The Deceiver will be convincing. The pressure will be intense.**

**But Christ is greater. His truth is stronger. His promises are certain.**

**Stand firm. Hold fast. Look up.**

**Your redemption draws near.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How soon do you think full disclosure will happen?**

A: The trajectory suggests within the next 5-10 years, possibly sooner. Government momentum is accelerating, mainstream acceptance is growing, and prophetic signs are converging. We can't date-set, but current patterns indicate it's imminent rather than distant. Prepare now.

**Q: What if disclosure happens and I realize I'm not ready?**

A: First, trust Christ immediately if you haven't. Then, do what you can with what you have where you are. Ground yourself in Scripture quickly, connect with prepared believers, commit to standing firm regardless of consequences. God's grace is sufficient even for those who prepared late.

**Q: Should I warn people who think I'm crazy?**

A: Yes, lovingly. You're accountable to speak truth (Ezekiel 3:18), not control their response. Plant seeds, pray, trust the Holy Spirit. Some who mock now may remember your words later when events unfold. Faithful witness is your responsibility; results are God's.

**Q: What if my church doesn't believe this interpretation?**

A: Don't let secondary interpretation divide you over core gospel. Stay in fellowship if the church preaches Christ faithfully. Share this understanding with those receptive, but maintain unity on essentials. If the church denies core doctrine or embraces the deception when it comes, then separation may be necessary.

**Q: Is it too late for people who've had "alien" encounters?**

A: No. Anyone can be saved through Christ (1 Timothy 1:15). These encounters are demonic, but Christ's blood is powerful enough to cleanse from any defilement. They need deliverance ministry, biblical counseling, discipleship in truth—but salvation and freedom are absolutely possible.

**Q: What about the Rapture—will we be here for disclosure?**

A: Timing depends on Rapture position (pre/mid/post-trib). If pre-trib, believers may be raptured before or during early disclosure. If mid/post-trib, we'll be here through disclosure and early Tribulation. Regardless, prepare as if you'll face it—if Rapture removes you early, you're over-prepared. Better that than under-prepared if you remain.
