What is the gospel? If someone asked you to explain salvation in three minutes, could you do it? The apostle Paul faced this exact need in first-century Corinth, where confusion about the resurrection threatened the church's foundation. His response—1 Corinthians 15—remains Scripture's clearest, most comprehensive explanation of the gospel message.

This isn't peripheral doctrine or secondary theology. Paul declares: "By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain" (1 Corinthians 15:2). Salvation hinges on understanding and believing this message.

This comprehensive guide explores 1 Corinthians 15's gospel presentation, examining what Christ accomplished through His death and resurrection, why the resurrection is non-negotiable, and how you can receive the salvation He offers.

## The Gospel Defined: 1 Corinthians 15:1-4

### Paul's Urgent Reminder

Paul begins with urgency: "Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you" (1 Corinthians 15:1). Despite their previous instruction, the Corinthians needed this reminder. **Gospel truths require constant reinforcement**—not because they're forgettable, but because their importance demands repetition.

### The Three Essential Elements

**1 Corinthians 15:3-4 provides the gospel's irreducible core:**

> "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that **Christ died for our sins** according to the Scriptures, that **he was buried**, that **he was raised on the third day** according to the Scriptures."

**Three non-negotiable facts:**

### 1. Christ Died for Our Sins

**"Christ died"**—not merely as martyr or example, but **"for our sins."** This death was substitutionary atonement.

**What this means:**

**Sin's penalty is death** (Romans 6:23). Every person has sinned (Romans 3:23), earning death as wages. We cannot pay this debt ourselves—attempting righteousness through works is futile (Ephesians 2:8-9).

**Christ took our place.** Isaiah 53:5 prophesied: "He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed."

**2 Corinthians 5:21:** "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

**Jesus became our substitute**—sinless yet bearing sin's penalty. His death wasn't tragedy but transaction: He exchanged His righteousness for our sin, His life for our death sentence.

**"According to the Scriptures"** establishes this wasn't accident. Old Testament prophecies pointed forward:

- Psalm 22 described crucifixion before it was invented
- Isaiah 53 detailed the suffering servant
- Genesis 22 foreshadowed God providing a sacrifice

**Christ's death fulfilled Scripture's promises.** God planned this from eternity past (Revelation 13:8).

### 2. He Was Buried

**"He was buried"** confirms Christ's death was real and complete. This isn't mythological symbolism—Jesus truly died.

**Why burial matters:**

**It verifies death's reality.** Ancient critics (like modern skeptics) might claim Jesus merely fainted or appeared dead. But Roman executioners verified death, Joseph of Arimathea prepared the body, and a stone sealed the tomb. **Jesus was truly, completely dead.**

**It fulfills Jonah's sign.** Jesus prophesied: "For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth" (Matthew 12:40). Burial fulfilled this prophecy.

**It makes resurrection meaningful.** Without real death and burial, resurrection would be unnecessary. The empty tomb's power depends on it previously being occupied by a corpse.

### 3. He Was Raised on the Third Day

**"He was raised on the third day"** declares Christianity's central claim: **Jesus conquered death.**

**Not resuscitation but resurrection:**

**Resuscitation** returns someone to mortal life—they'll die again. Lazarus was resuscitated (John 11), but he eventually died.

**Resurrection** transforms into immortal life. Jesus rose with a glorified body—physical yet imperishable, recognizable yet transcendent. He'll never die again (Romans 6:9).

**"According to the Scriptures"** again emphasizes fulfillment:

- Psalm 16:10: "You will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay."
- Hosea 6:2: "After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us."

**The third day wasn't random**—it fulfilled prophecy and demonstrated God's power over death's timeline.

## The Evidence: Eyewitness Testimony (1 Corinthians 15:5-8)

Paul doesn't expect blind faith. He provides evidence:

### The Witnesses

**1 Corinthians 15:5-8 lists resurrection appearances:**

**1. Peter (Cephas):** Luke 24:34 confirms this private appearance.

**2. The Twelve:** The apostolic core witnessed risen Christ (John 20:19-23).

**3. More than 500 brothers at once:** Most still living when Paul wrote—inviting verification. "Go ask them yourselves" was Paul's implicit challenge.

**4. James:** Jesus' skeptical half-brother (John 7:5) became a believer after encountering risen Christ. What could convert a skeptic except seeing the resurrected Lord?

**5. All the apostles:** Multiple group appearances.

**6. Paul himself:** "Last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born" (1 Corinthians 15:8). Paul's Damascus Road encounter (Acts 9) transformed him from persecutor to apostle.

### Why This Evidence Matters

**Multiple witnesses over time.** These weren't hallucinations—individuals don't share identical hallucinations. Groups don't experience mass delusions across weeks.

**Hostile witnesses converted.** Paul persecuted Christians. James disbelieved Jesus during His ministry. Yet both became leaders after resurrection encounters. **Something extraordinary happened.**

**Willingness to die.** These witnesses didn't just claim they saw Jesus—they died for that claim. People die for lies they believe, but these witnesses knew whether they'd seen risen Christ or not. They chose martyrdom rather than recant eyewitness testimony.

**Historical credibility.** Paul writing within 20-25 years of the event, while eyewitnesses lived and could be consulted, provides remarkable historical proximity. Ancient historians dream of such early, verifiable sources.

## Why the Resurrection Matters (1 Corinthians 15:12-19)

Some Corinthians doubted resurrection's possibility. Paul devastates this view:

### If Christ Hasn't Been Raised...

**1 Corinthians 15:14:** "And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith."

**Christianity without resurrection = worthless religion.** Remove the resurrection, and Christianity collapses into empty moralism—"be good like Jesus tried to be." But Jesus didn't come to model goodness; He came to conquer death.

**1 Corinthians 15:17:** "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."

**No resurrection = no salvation.** Jesus' death alone doesn't save—His resurrection validates His sacrifice. **The resurrection proves:**

- God accepted Christ's atonement
- Sin's power is broken
- Death is defeated
- Eternal life is available

**Without resurrection, sin's penalty stands unpaid.**

**1 Corinthians 15:18:** "Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost."

**No resurrection = no afterlife for believers.** Christians who died would be simply dead—perished, annihilated, lost. Their faith would have been misplaced hope.

**1 Corinthians 15:19:** "If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied."

**Christianity without resurrection = tragic delusion.** If death ends everything, Christians have wasted their lives on false hope. **Paul stakes everything on resurrection's reality.**

### The Resurrection Changes Everything

**But Christ HAS been raised!** Therefore:

**Your faith isn't useless**—it's anchored in historical reality.

**You're not still in your sins**—forgiveness is real, purchased by validated sacrifice.

**Death isn't final**—resurrection guarantees believers' future resurrection.

**Hope extends beyond this life**—eternal life is certain, not wishful thinking.

**The resurrection is Christianity's foundation.** Remove it, and everything crumbles. Affirm it, and everything stands secure.

## The Firstfruits: Christ's Resurrection Guarantees Ours (1 Corinthians 15:20-28)

### Christ as Firstfruits

**1 Corinthians 15:20:** "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."

**"Firstfruits"** was Old Testament terminology—the first portion of harvest, guaranteeing more to come. **Christ's resurrection isn't isolated miracle but preview of believers' future resurrection.**

**His resurrection guarantees ours.** As the first sheaf promised full harvest, Christ's rising promises all believers will rise.

### Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ

**1 Corinthians 15:21-22:** "For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."

**Two representatives for humanity:**

**Adam:** Through his disobedience, sin and death entered the world (Romans 5:12). Every human inherits Adam's fallen nature—we're born spiritually dead, destined for physical death.

**Christ (the Last Adam):** Through His obedience, righteousness and life became available. Those "in Christ" through faith receive His righteousness and resurrection life.

**Everyone is either "in Adam" or "in Christ."** In Adam = under sin's curse, destined for death. In Christ = forgiven, destined for resurrection life.

### The Final Victory

**1 Corinthians 15:24-26:** "Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death."

**Death is an enemy**—not natural or neutral, but hostile intruder. Christ came to destroy this enemy.

**At Christ's return:**

- All opposing powers will be defeated
- Death itself will be abolished
- God's kingdom will be fully established
- Believers will be resurrected with glorified bodies

**Death won't merely be avoided—it will be destroyed.** No one will ever die again. Mortality will give way to immortality.

## The Resurrection Body (1 Corinthians 15:35-49)

### What Will Our Resurrection Bodies Be Like?

**People asked Paul:** "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?" (1 Corinthians 15:35).

Paul explains through analogy:

### The Seed and the Plant

**1 Corinthians 15:36-38:** "What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed... But God gives it a body as he has determined."

**A seed buried in soil dies—but that death produces new life.** The plant doesn't look like the seed. Same essence, transformed form.

**Your current body is like a seed.** Death plants it in the earth. Resurrection raises it transformed—same person, glorified body.

### Perishable to Imperishable

**1 Corinthians 15:42-44:**

> "So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body."

### Like Christ's Resurrection Body

**1 Corinthians 15:49:** "And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man."

**Currently, we bear Adam's image**—mortal, corruptible. **At resurrection, we'll bear Christ's image**—immortal, glorified.

**Jesus' resurrection body provides the template:** Physical (He ate fish, could be touched), yet transcendent (He appeared in locked rooms, ascended to heaven). Our bodies will be similar—real, physical, yet glorified beyond current limitations.

## Victory Over Death (1 Corinthians 15:50-58)

### The Transformation

**1 Corinthians 15:51-52:**

> "Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."

**"We will not all sleep" (die)** means some believers will be alive when Christ returns. They won't experience death but will be instantly transformed.

**"In the twinkling of an eye"**—faster than blinking. Instantaneous transformation from mortal to immortal.

**"The dead will be raised"**—believers who died will resurrect first (1 Thessalonians 4:16).

**"We will be changed"**—living believers transformed immediately.

### Death Swallowed in Victory

**1 Corinthians 15:54-57:**

> "When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory.' 'Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?' The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

**Death's sting = sin.** Death has power over us because we're sinners deserving judgment. Sin gives death its terror.

**Christ removed sin's penalty.** Through His death and resurrection, He conquered sin, rendering death's sting powerless for believers.

**Death no longer wins.** For believers, death is merely transition—temporary separation of body and soul before resurrection. It's not defeat but doorway to glory.

### Therefore Stand Firm

**1 Corinthians 15:58:**

> "Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."

**"Therefore"** connects application to theology. **Because Christ conquered death:**

**Stand firm:** Don't waver in faith. Resurrection certainty produces steadfast confidence.

**Let nothing move you:** Opposition, suffering, doubt—none should shake believers who know resurrection awaits.

**Give yourselves fully:** Resurrection hope motivates sacrificial service. If death isn't final, no earthly cost is too great.

**Your labor is not in vain:** Every act of service, every sacrifice for Christ, has eternal significance. Resurrection guarantees reward.

## How to Receive Salvation

Understanding the gospel intellectually isn't enough. You must respond.

### The Requirement: Faith

**Ephesians 2:8-9:** "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

**Salvation is by grace through faith:**

**Grace = God's unmerited favor.** You can't earn salvation. Christ's work is sufficient; your work is insufficient.

**Faith = trusting Christ alone for salvation.** Not faith in your goodness, church attendance, baptism, or religion—faith in Christ's finished work.

### What Saving Faith Involves

**1. Acknowledge your sin:** Romans 3:23—"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Admit you're a sinner deserving judgment.

**2. Believe Christ died for your sins and rose again:** Romans 10:9—"If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

**3. Repent:** Acts 3:19—"Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out." Repentance means changing direction—turning from sin to Christ.

**4. Receive Christ:** John 1:12—"Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God." Salvation isn't just believing facts; it's receiving a person—Jesus Christ.

### A Prayer of Salvation

**If you've never trusted Christ, you can receive Him now:**

*"Lord Jesus, I acknowledge I'm a sinner deserving judgment. I believe You died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead. I repent of my sins and receive You as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for forgiving me and giving me eternal life. Amen."*

**If you prayed sincerely, God promises you're saved** (Romans 10:13). Your sins are forgiven. You have eternal life. You will be resurrected when Christ returns.

### What Happens Next?

**If you just trusted Christ:**

**1. Tell someone:** Matthew 10:32—confess Christ publicly.

**2. Get baptized:** Acts 2:38—baptism publicly declares your faith.

**3. Find a Bible-believing church:** Hebrews 10:25—regular fellowship is essential.

**4. Read Scripture:** 1 Peter 2:2—grow through God's Word.

**5. Pray:** Philippians 4:6—maintain communication with God.

**6. Share the gospel:** Matthew 28:19-20—tell others about Christ.

## Common Questions About Salvation

**Q: Can I lose my salvation?**

**True believers cannot lose salvation.** John 10:28-29: "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand." Romans 8:38-39 promises nothing can separate believers from God's love. Salvation is God's work, secured by Christ's resurrection. However, those who "fall away" likely never truly believed (1 John 2:19).

**Q: What about people who never hear the gospel?**

**Scripture teaches:** (1) General revelation (creation) makes God's existence evident (Romans 1:20), leaving all accountable. (2) God judges according to light received. (3) Everyone has sinned and needs Christ. (4) God's judgment is perfect and fair. Trust His character. Your responsibility: share the gospel with those who haven't heard.

**Q: Isn't it arrogant to claim certainty about salvation?**

**No—it's trusting God's promise.** 1 John 5:13: "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life." Certainty isn't arrogance; it's faith in Christ's sufficient sacrifice. Uncertainty insults His completed work.

**Q: What if I don't feel saved?**

**Feelings fluctuate; God's promises don't.** Salvation depends on Christ's work, not your emotions. John 6:37: "Whoever comes to me I will never drive away." If you've trusted Christ, you're saved regardless of feelings. Feelings will align as you grow in faith.

**Q: Do I need to be baptized to be saved?**

**Baptism doesn't save—faith does.** The thief on the cross received salvation without baptism (Luke 23:43). However, baptism is commanded for believers (Matthew 28:19) and publicly identifies you with Christ. If you're saved, get baptized promptly as an act of obedience.

**Q: What about my past sins?**

**All sins—past, present, future—are forgiven in Christ.** Colossians 2:13-14: "He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness." No sin is too great for Christ's blood to cover. Your past doesn't disqualify you; it demonstrates your need for the Savior.

**Q: Can I live however I want if I'm saved by grace?**

**Grace doesn't promote license but transformation.** Romans 6:1-2: "Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means!" True salvation produces changed desires and behavior (2 Corinthians 5:17). If someone claims salvation but lives unchanged, their profession is questionable (James 2:17).

## Conclusion: The Gospel That Saves

The gospel isn't complicated, but it's profound:

**Christ died for our sins.**

**He was buried.**

**He rose on the third day.**

This three-fold message holds salvation's power. Death conquered. Sin forgiven. Eternal life secured.

**If you haven't trusted Christ, today is your day.** 2 Corinthians 6:2: "Now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Don't delay—tomorrow isn't promised.

**If you have trusted Christ, let this truth transform you:** Because Jesus rose, death is defeated. Your labor isn't in vain. Your future is secure. Your body will be resurrected. Your Savior reigns victorious.

**Stand firm in this gospel.** Let nothing move you from resurrection hope. Give yourself fully to Christ's work, knowing that when He returns, you'll rise imperishable, glorious, powerful—bearing His image forever.

**1 Corinthians 15:57:** "Thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

**That victory is yours today if you'll receive it. Believe the gospel. Trust the risen Christ. Receive eternal life.**

**The resurrection changes everything. Let it change you.**
