What happened there became one of the most glorious moments recorded in Scripture:\n\n> *\"There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.\"* (Matthew 17:2-3, NIV)\n\nFor a brief, stunning moment, the veil between heaven and earth lifted. Jesus's **glory**—normally hidden beneath human flesh—blazed forth in radiant brilliance. Two of Israel's greatest figures materialized from the dead to speak with Him. And the Father's voice thundered from heaven, declaring Jesus's identity to awestruck witnesses.\n\nThe **Transfiguration** (from Latin *transfigurare*, \"to change in form\") wasn't just a spectacular display. It was a **confirmation** of Jesus's divine nature, a **preview** of His resurrection glory, and a **turning point** in His ministry as He prepared to face the cross.\n\nBut where did this happen? Why these particular witnesses? What were Moses and Elijah discussing with Jesus? And why does Peter's response—building shelters—seem so odd?\n\nUnderstanding the Transfiguration requires understanding its location, its witnesses, its timing, and its purpose. When we grasp these elements, this mysterious event illuminates Jesus's mission and gives us a glimpse of the glory that awaits all believers.\n\n## The Three Accounts: Synoptic Agreement\n\nAll three synoptic Gospels record the Transfiguration, with remarkable agreement on the core details:\n\n### Matthew's Account (Matthew 17:1-13)\n\n> *\"After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.' While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!' When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. 'Get up,' he said. 'Don't be afraid.' When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.\"* (Matthew 17:1-8, NIV)\n\n**Matthew emphasizes**:\n\n- \"Six days\" timing (connecting to Caesarea Philippi)\n\n- Jesus's face shining \"like the sun\"\n\n- The bright cloud covering them\n\n- The disciples' terror and falling facedown\n\n- Jesus's comforting touch\n\n### Mark's Account (Mark 9:2-13)\n\n> *\"After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.\"* (Mark 9:2-4, NIV)\n\n**Mark emphasizes**:\n\n- They were \"all alone\" (privacy on the mountain)\n\n- Clothes \"whiter than anyone could bleach them\" (supernatural whiteness)\n\n- Elijah listed before Moses (interesting reversal)\n\n### Luke's Account (Luke 9:28-36)\n\n> *\"About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.\"* (Luke 9:28-31, NIV)\n\n**Luke adds unique details**:\n\n- Purpose: Jesus went up \"to pray\"\n\n- What they discussed: Jesus's \"departure\" (Greek: *exodos*—His death, resurrection, ascension)\n\n- Moses and Elijah appeared \"in glorious splendor\"\n\n- Peter and the others were \"very sleepy\" but stayed awake (Luke 9:32)\n\n- The disciples were afraid as they entered the cloud (Luke 9:34)\n\n### Core Agreement Across All Three\n\nDespite minor variations, all three Gospels agree on:\n\n1. **Timing**: Six days (Matthew/Mark) or about eight days (Luke) after Caesarea Philippi\n\n2. **Location**: A high mountain, privately\n\n3. **Witnesses**: Peter, James, and John only\n\n4. **Transformation**: Jesus's appearance changed dramatically—face and clothes radiantly white\n\n5. **Visitors**: Moses and Elijah appeared and conversed with Jesus\n\n6. **Peter's response**: Wanted to build three shelters\n\n7. **Cloud**: A bright cloud covered them\n\n8. **Voice**: God's voice declared, \"This is my Son... Listen to him!\"\n\n9. **Fear**: The disciples were terrified\n\n10. **Command of silence**: Jesus told them not to tell anyone until after His resurrection\n\nThis rare agreement across all three synoptic Gospels underscores the event's importance and its accurate transmission.\n\n## The Location: Mount Hermon or Mount Tabor?\n\nThe Gospels describe \"a high mountain\" but don't name it specifically. Two locations compete for identification:\n\n### Traditional Location: Mount Tabor\n\n**Church tradition since the 4th century** places the Transfiguration on **Mount Tabor**, approximately 11 miles west of the Sea of Galilee.\n\n**Arguments for Mount Tabor**:\n\n- Early Christian tradition (Origen, Jerome, Cyril of Jerusalem)\n\n- Churches built there commemorating the event\n\n- Accessible location near Galilee\n\n- Beautiful, symmetrical dome shape\n\n- Fits description of \"high\" for that region\n\n**Arguments against Mount Tabor**:\n\n- **Height**: Only 1,886 feet (575 meters)—hardly \"very high\"\n\n- **Fortress**: A Hasmonean/Roman fortress stood at the summit during Jesus's time—not \"alone\"\n\n- **Distance**: 65 miles south of Caesarea Philippi where Jesus just was\n\n- **Timing**: Difficult to reach in six days from Caesarea Philippi\n\n- **Privacy**: Fortified mountain wouldn't provide the solitude described\n\n### Probable Location: Mount Hermon\n\n**Mount Hermon** offers more compelling geographic and contextual evidence:\n\n**Arguments for Mount Hermon**:\n\n**1. Proximity to Caesarea Philippi**\n\n> *\"When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi...\"* (Matthew 16:13)\n\nJesus was **at Caesarea Philippi** when Peter made his confession. Caesarea Philippi sits **at the base of Mount Hermon**. Six days later, Jesus went up \"a high mountain\" nearby. The natural candidate is the mountain immediately above them—Hermon.\n\n**2. True \"High Mountain\"**\n\n- **Height**: 9,232 feet (2,814 meters)—the highest peak in the region\n\n- **Truly \"high\"**: Deserves the description better than Tabor's modest elevation\n\n- **Snow-capped**: Summit has permanent snow, creating natural imagery of dazzling whiteness\n\n- **Privacy**: Remote, uninhabited summit provides true isolation\n\n**3. Geographic Continuity**\n\nMatthew 17:22 says, \"When they came together in Galilee...\" suggesting they traveled south **back to** Galilee after the Transfiguration. If they were already at Mount Tabor (in Galilee), this phrasing doesn't make sense. But descending from Mount Hermon **to** Galilee does.\n\n**4. The \"Six Days\" Timing**\n\n- Day 1: Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi\n\n- Days 2-5: Teaching and preparation\n\n- Day 6: Ascent of Mount Hermon\n\n- Transfiguration occurs\n\nThe timeline fits perfectly for staying in the Caesarea Philippi region.\n\n**5. Spiritual Symbolism**\n\n[Mount Hermon's profound spiritual significance](/mount-hermon-bible-meaning) makes it the perfect location:\n\n- **Site of rebellion**: Where [the Watchers descended](/who-are-the-watchers-the-fallen-angels-who-descended-to-earth) (1 Enoch 6:6)\n\n- **Place of corruption**: Where angels violated divine order\n\n- **Gateway to evil**: Beginning point of pre-Flood wickedness\n\n- **Northern boundary**: Edge of the Promised Land\n\n**The redemptive symbolism**:\n\n- **Where angels fell, the Son of God was glorified**\n\n- **Where rebellion occurred, obedience was displayed**\n\n- **Where heaven wrongly touched earth, it rightly revealed glory**\n\n- **Where darkness originated, light blazed forth**\n\nJesus's transfiguration on Mount Hermon would **redeem** the very mountain where cosmic rebellion began.\n\n**6. The Bright Cloud and Whiteness**\n\nMount Hermon's snow-covered peaks create a natural parallel:\n\n- Jesus's clothes became \"white as light\" (Matthew 17:2)\n\n- \"Whiter than anyone could bleach them\" (Mark 9:3)\n\n- The snow at Hermon's summit is brilliantly white\n\n- The imagery naturally fits the location\n\n### The Verdict\n\nWhile we can't be absolutely certain, **Mount Hermon presents far more compelling evidence** than Mount Tabor. The geographic context, timing, height, privacy, and profound spiritual symbolism all point to Hermon as the likely location.\n\nEarly Christian tradition favored Mount Tabor largely because it was more accessible for pilgrims and already had Christian communities nearby. But the biblical evidence favors Hermon.\n\n## The Witnesses: Why Peter, James, and John?\n\nJesus brought only three disciples—why these three?\n\n### The Inner Circle\n\nPeter, James, and John formed an **inner circle** among the Twelve, present at key moments others missed:\n\n**1. Raising of Jairus's Daughter** (Mark 5:37)\n\nOnly these three witnessed Jesus raise a dead girl to life.\n\n**2. The Transfiguration** (Matthew 17:1)\n\nThis glorious revelation was shared with only these three.\n\n**3. Garden of Gethsemane** (Matthew 26:37)\n\nOnly these three accompanied Jesus deeper into the garden during His agony.\n\n**The pattern**: At moments of extreme **glory** (Transfiguration) and extreme **suffering** (Gethsemane), Jesus brought these three closest.\n\n### Why These Three Specifically?\n\n**Peter**:\n\n- Leader of the Twelve\n\n- Spokesman for the group\n\n- Recently confessed Jesus as Messiah (Matthew 16:16)\n\n- Would deny Jesus three times but be restored\n\n- Needed strengthening for future leadership\n\n**James**:\n\n- First apostle to be martyred (Acts 12:2)\n\n- Needed this glimpse of glory before facing violent death\n\n- Brother of John, son of Zebedee\n\n- Part of the \"Sons of Thunder\" (Mark 3:17)\n\n**John**:\n\n- \"The disciple whom Jesus loved\" (John 13:23)\n\n- Longest-living apostle\n\n- Would write five New Testament books\n\n- Needed the experience to write about Jesus's glory (John 1:14)\n\n- Present at the cross (John 19:26-27)\n\n**Together**, they represented:\n\n- Leadership (Peter)\n\n- Martyrdom (James)\n\n- Long witness (John)\n\nThese three would carry the memory of Jesus's glory through:\n\n- Peter's denial and restoration\n\n- James's martyrdom\n\n- John's decades of ministry and exile\n\nThe Transfiguration strengthened them for what lay ahead.\n\n### Why Not All Twelve?\n\n**Practical reasons**:\n\n- Climbing a 9,000-foot mountain with twelve men is difficult\n\n- Privacy was essential for this revelation\n\n- Not all were spiritually ready for this experience\n\n**Theological reasons**:\n\n- **Moses** brought only Joshua partway up Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:13)\n\n- **Jesus** brought only three partway into His glory\n\n- Some revelations are given to specific people for specific purposes\n\n- Greater revelation requires greater spiritual capacity\n\n**Progressive revelation**: Just as the inner three saw more than the Twelve, and the Twelve saw more than the crowds, God reveals Himself progressively based on readiness and purpose.\n\n## The Transformation: Jesus's Glory Revealed\n\nThe central event was Jesus's **transfiguration**—the Greek word **μεταμορφόω** (*metamorphoō*), meaning \"to transform\" or \"to change in form.\"\n\n### Physical Changes\n\n**Face**:\n\n> *\"His face shone like the sun.\"* (Matthew 17:2, NIV)\n\nNot reflected light (like Moses's face reflecting God's glory in Exodus 34:29-35), but **emanating** light from within. Jesus's divine nature, normally veiled by flesh, blazed forth.\n\n**Clothes**:\n\n> *\"His clothes became as white as the light... whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.\"* (Matthew 17:2, Mark 9:3, NIV)\n\nSupernatural whiteness beyond human achievement. The description emphasizes **purity**, **holiness**, and **otherness**—this was glory no earthly process could produce.\n\n**Appearance**:\n\n> *\"The appearance of his face changed.\"* (Luke 9:29, NIV)\n\nHis very form was altered. This wasn't makeup or lighting—His actual appearance transformed into something transcendent.\n\n### What the Disciples Saw\n\nThe disciples witnessed:\n\n- **Jesus's divine nature**: The glory He possessed before creation (John 17:5)\n\n- **His resurrection body**: A preview of what He would be after rising from death\n\n- **His heavenly glory**: How He appears at the Father's right hand\n\n- **His second coming**: How He will return—in glory and majesty (Matthew 24:30)\n\n**This was no miracle** performed on someone else—this was Jesus revealing **who He truly is** beneath the human flesh.\n\n### Theological Significance\n\n**1. Confirmation of Deity**\n\nPeter had just confessed, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God\" (Matthew 16:16). The Transfiguration **confirmed** this confession. Jesus wasn't just a man claiming divinity—He possessed actual divine glory.\n\n**2. Fulfillment of Prophecy**\n\n> *\"His face shone like the sun.\"* (Matthew 17:2)\n\nThis echoes Daniel's vision:\n\n> *\"His face was like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches.\"* (Daniel 10:6, NIV)\n\nAnd John's vision in Revelation:\n\n> *\"His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.\"* (Revelation 1:16, NIV)\n\nThe Transfiguration demonstrated Jesus as the fulfillment of apocalyptic prophecies about God's Messiah.\n\n**3. Preview of Resurrection**\n\nThe glory revealed at the Transfiguration was the same glory Jesus would possess after resurrection:\n\n- Appearance transformed\n\n- Emanating light\n\n- Transcending earthly limitations\n\n- Moving between heaven and earth\n\n**The disciples saw** what Jesus would permanently become after conquering death.\n\n**4. Priesthood Confirmation**\n\nThe **bright cloud** and **God's voice** echoed Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:15-18), where God gave the Law through Moses. Jesus's transfiguration on a mountain with God's voice declaring \"Listen to him!\" positioned Jesus as the **new** and **greater** Moses—the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.\n\n## The Visitors: Moses and Elijah\n\nTwo figures appeared with Jesus—why these two specifically?\n\n### Moses: Representing the Law\n\n**Moses** (1526-1406 BCE, traditional dating) was Israel's greatest lawgiver and prophet.\n\n**His significance**:\n\n- Received the Law on Mount Sinai\n\n- Led Israel out of Egypt\n\n- Mediated the Old Covenant\n\n- Wrote the Torah (first five books)\n\n- Spoke with God \"face to face\" (Exodus 33:11)\n\n**His death**: Deuteronomy 34:5-6 records that God buried Moses, and no one knows where. This mysterious burial becomes relevant—Moses appears at the Transfiguration despite having died 1,400 years earlier.\n\n**His presence at the Transfiguration symbolized**:\n\n- The **Law**\n\n- The **Old Covenant**\n\n- **God's written revelation**\n\n- **Israel's salvation history**\n\n### Elijah: Representing the Prophets\n\n**Elijah** (9th century BCE) was one of Israel's greatest prophets.\n\n**His significance**:\n\n- Called down fire from heaven (1 Kings 18)\n\n- Confronted wicked King Ahab\n\n- Raised the dead (1 Kings 17:17-24)\n\n- Challenged Baal worship\n\n- Was taken to heaven without dying (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n**His translation**: Unlike Moses who died, Elijah was taken directly to heaven in a whirlwind, riding a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11). He never experienced death.\n\n**His presence at the Transfiguration symbolized**:\n\n- The **Prophets**\n\n- **God's spoken word**\n\n- **Expectation of Messiah**\n\n- **Zeal for God's glory**\n\n### Together: The Law and the Prophets\n\n**Moses and Elijah** together represented the entirety of Old Testament Scripture:\n\n- **The Law**: Torah (Moses)\n\n- **The Prophets**: Nevi'im (Elijah)\n\nThis was the Jewish way of referring to what we call the Old Testament. Their appearance testified that:\n\n- **Jesus fulfills** all of Scripture\n\n- **The Old Testament points to** Christ\n\n- **The Law and Prophets** find their completion in Him\n\n- **All Scripture** bears witness to Jesus (Luke 24:27)\n\n### Why These Two Specifically?\n\n**1. Mountain Encounters with God**\n\nBoth Moses and Elijah had profound encounters with God on mountains:\n\n**Moses on Mount Sinai**:\n\n- Received the Ten Commandments\n\n- Face shone after seeing God's glory\n\n- Spent forty days on the mountain\n\n- Mediated the covenant\n\n**Elijah on Mount Horeb (Sinai)**:\n\n- Fled there after defeating Baal's prophets\n\n- Experienced God in \"a gentle whisper\" (1 Kings 19:12)\n\n- Received renewed commission\n\n- Prophesied Ahab's judgment\n\nBoth men's mountaintop experiences with God made them fitting witnesses to Jesus's mountaintop transfiguration.\n\n**2. Both Left Mysteriously**\n\n**Moses**: God buried him; no one knows where (Deuteronomy 34:6)\n\n**Elijah**: Taken to heaven without dying (2 Kings 2:11)\n\nTheir mysterious departures made their reappearance at the Transfiguration even more remarkable—proof that:\n\n- Those who die in faith live on\n\n- God can bring back even the dead\n\n- The veil between heaven and earth is thin\n\n- Resurrection and eternal life are real\n\n**3. Messianic Expectations**\n\nJewish tradition expected both to return:\n\n**Moses redivivus**: Some expected Moses to return (based on Deuteronomy 18:15—\"a prophet like me\")\n\n**Elijah's return**: Malachi 4:5 explicitly prophesied Elijah's return before the \"great and dreadful day of the Lord\"\n\nTheir appearance demonstrated:\n\n- Messianic prophecies were being fulfilled\n\n- Jesus was greater than Moses and Elijah\n\n- The age of fulfillment had arrived\n\n### What They Discussed: Jesus's Exodus\n\nLuke provides the crucial detail other Gospels omit:\n\n> *\"They spoke about his departure [ἔξοδος, *exodos*], which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.\"* (Luke 9:31, NIV)\n\n**The Greek word *exodos*** literally means \"exit\" or \"departure\"—the same word used for Israel's Exodus from Egypt. But in context, it refers to Jesus's:\n\n- **Death**\n\n- **Resurrection**\n\n- **Ascension**\n\nThis wasn't small talk—they discussed **Jesus's mission**: His coming sacrifice, His victory over death, and His return to the Father.\n\n**Why this conversation mattered**:\n\n1. **Moses** led the first exodus (from physical slavery in Egypt)\n\n2. **Jesus** would lead the ultimate exodus (from spiritual slavery to sin and death)\n\n3. **Elijah** had experienced being taken to heaven—now Jesus would ascend after resurrection\n\n4. **Both** understood suffering and obedience—preparing Jesus for the cross\n\nThe conversation confirmed that:\n\n- Jesus's death was planned and purposeful\n\n- His suffering fulfilled God's eternal design\n\n- Even the greatest Old Testament saints knew the Messiah must suffer\n\n- The cross wasn't defeat but victory\n\n## Peter's Response: Building Shelters\n\nPeter's reaction to this glorious vision seems odd:\n\n> *\"Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.'\"* (Matthew 17:4, NIV)\n\n**Mark adds**: \"He did not know what to say, they were so frightened\" (Mark 9:6)\n\n**Luke adds**: \"He did not know what he was saying\" (Luke 9:33)\n\n### What Peter Meant\n\n**\"Shelters\"** (Greek: **σκηνή**, *skēnē*; Hebrew: **סֻכָּה**, *sukkah*):\n\n- Temporary dwelling places\n\n- Tabernacles or booths\n\n- Associated with the Feast of Tabernacles\n\n**Peter's intentions** (probably):\n\n**1. Prolong the moment**\n\n- Don't let this glory end\n\n- Stay here forever\n\n- Avoid returning to the difficult path ahead\n\n**2. Honor all three equally**\n\n- One shelter each for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah\n\n- Treating them as equals\n\n- Missing Jesus's supremacy\n\n**3. Celebrate like Tabernacles**\n\n- The Feast of Tabernacles celebrated God dwelling with Israel\n\n- Building booths commemorated wilderness wandering\n\n- Perhaps Peter thought the Messianic age had arrived\n\n**4. Capture and contain the glory**\n\n- Build something permanent\n\n- Create a shrine\n\n- Institutionalize the experience\n\n### What Peter Got Wrong\n\n**1. Missed the mission**\n\nJesus came to die, not to stay on the mountain. The Transfiguration was a **preview**, not the destination. Peter wanted to freeze time when Jesus needed to move forward.\n\n**2. Misunderstood Jesus's supremacy**\n\nThree equal shelters implied Moses and Elijah were on par with Jesus. But Jesus is **greater than** Moses and Elijah combined. He didn't come to join them—He came to **fulfill** what they represented.\n\n**3. Avoided the cross**\n\nPeter's suggestion echoed his earlier rebuke of Jesus (Matthew 16:22): \"Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!\" Both times, Peter tried to divert Jesus from suffering. But the path to resurrection **requires** the cross.\n\n**4. Tried to capture what can't be contained**\n\nYou can't bottle glory, freeze revelation, or institutionalize encounter. God's presence can't be shrined—it must be followed.\n\n### What Peter Got Right\n\n**\"It is good for us to be here\"**—at least Peter recognized the privilege of experiencing this moment!\n\nDespite his misguided suggestion, Peter's heart was in the right place. He wanted to stay in God's presence, honor Jesus, and preserve the experience. The problem wasn't his desire but his method.\n\n**God's response** came immediately, cutting Peter off mid-sentence.\n\n## The Father's Voice: Divine Confirmation\n\n> *\"While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!'\"* (Matthew 17:5, NIV)\n\n### The Bright Cloud\n\n**The cloud** signaled **God's presence**—the same cloud (*Shekinah* glory) that:\n\n- Led Israel through the wilderness (Exodus 13:21)\n\n- Filled the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:34)\n\n- Filled Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 8:10-11)\n\n- Covered Mount Sinai when God gave the Law (Exodus 24:15-18)\n\n**\"Bright\" cloud**: Not dark and foreboding but **radiant**—full of glory and light.\n\nWhen the cloud covered them, the disciples **entered** God's presence. Luke adds they \"were afraid as they entered the cloud\" (Luke 9:34)—a natural response to encountering holiness.\n\n### The Father's Declaration\n\n**\"This is my Son\"**—echoes Jesus's baptism (Matthew 3:17), confirming His identity\n\n**\"Whom I love\"**—expresses the eternal love between Father and Son\n\n**\"With him I am well pleased\"**—declares approval of Jesus's mission and character\n\n**\"Listen to him!\"**—commands obedience and attention\n\n### Three Critical Points\n\n**1. Jesus's Supremacy Over Moses and Elijah**\n\nPeter wanted to honor all three equally. God's voice **silenced** that suggestion:\n\n- \"This is my **Son**\"—Jesus alone holds this unique relationship\n\n- Not \"These are my servants\" (Moses and Elijah)\n\n- But \"This is my **Son**\"\n\n**Moses and Elijah** were servants.\n\n**Jesus** is the Son.\n\nThe Father effectively said: \"Peter, you're right that it's good to be here—but don't put my Son on the same level as His servants.\"\n\n**2. Transfer of Authority from the Law and Prophets**\n\n**\"Listen to him!\"**—specifically commands obedience to Jesus.\n\nNot:\n\n- \"Listen to Moses\" (though Israel did for 1,400 years)\n\n- \"Listen to Elijah\" (though he confronted kings)\n\n- \"Listen to all three equally\"\n\nBut: **\"Listen to HIM\"**—Jesus alone.\n\n**The New Covenant** supersedes the Old. The **ultimate revelation** has come. Moses gave the Law, Elijah spoke for God, but **Jesus IS God's final Word** (Hebrews 1:1-2).\n\n**3. Confirmation of Peter's Confession**\n\nSix days earlier, Peter had declared: \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God\" (Matthew 16:16).\n\nNow, the **Father confirmed** Peter's confession from heaven:\n\n- \"This is my **Son**\"—Peter was right\n\n- God revealed it to Peter (Matthew 16:17)\n\n- God now publicly declares it\n\nThe Transfiguration was **God's \"Amen\"** to Peter's confession.\n\n## The Disciples' Response: Terror and Comfort\n\n> *\"When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.\"* (Matthew 17:6, NIV)\n\n**Terror** was appropriate—they had:\n\n- Seen Jesus's divine glory\n\n- Witnessed dead saints appear\n\n- Heard God's voice from heaven\n\n- Entered the cloud of His presence\n\n**This was holy fear**—recognition of their smallness before God's majesty.\n\n**But Jesus responded**:\n\n> *\"But Jesus came and touched them. 'Get up,' he said. 'Don't be afraid.' When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.\"* (Matthew 17:7-8, NIV)\n\n**His actions**:\n\n- **Touched them**: Physical reassurance\n\n- **Spoke**: \"Get up\" and \"Don't be afraid\"\n\n- **Remained**: When they looked up, only Jesus was there\n\n**The symbolism**:\n\n- **Moses** (Law) was gone\n\n- **Elijah** (Prophets) was gone\n\n- **The cloud** (God's presence) had departed\n\n- But **Jesus remained**\n\n**The message**: In Jesus, we have everything. The Law and Prophets pointed to Him. God's presence dwells in Him. We don't need Moses, Elijah, special experiences, or theophany clouds—we have **Jesus**.\n\nAnd He says: **\"Don't be afraid.\"**\n\n## The Command of Silence\n\n> *\"As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, 'Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.'\"* (Matthew 17:9, NIV)\n\n**Why the silence?**\n\n**1. Misunderstanding risk**\n\nIf the disciples told others about the Transfiguration, people might:\n\n- Try to make Jesus an earthly king immediately\n\n- Miss the necessity of the cross\n\n- Expect constant glory instead of patient faith\n\n- Misinterpret Jesus's mission\n\n**2. Timing**\n\nThe Transfiguration would only make sense **after** the resurrection. Before then, it would confuse rather than clarify. Only after Jesus died and rose could people understand why He was transfigured between dying and rising.\n\n**3. The cross must come first**\n\nGlory follows suffering. Resurrection follows crucifixion. The crown comes after the cross. Revealing the Transfiguration too soon might cause people to skip straight to glory without understanding the cost.\n\n**\"Until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead\"**—the Transfiguration testifies to resurrection. Once Jesus rose, the disciples could explain: \"We saw His glory before He died, confirming He would rise again.\"\n\n## Spiritual Lessons for Today\n\nThe Transfiguration holds profound applications for modern believers.\n\n### 1. Jesus Is Sufficient\n\n**\"They saw no one except Jesus\"** (Matthew 17:8)—the ultimate lesson.\n\nYou don't need:\n\n- Experiences (though God may give them)\n\n- Special revelations (Scripture is sufficient)\n\n- Moses (the Law is fulfilled)\n\n- Elijah (prophecy is complete)\n\n- Mystical clouds (the Holy Spirit indwells you)\n\n**You need Jesus**—and in Him, you have everything.\n\n**Modern application**: Stop chasing experiences and pursue Jesus Himself. The glory isn't in the experience but in the Person.\n\n### 2. Glory Follows Suffering\n\nThe Transfiguration occurred **between** Peter's confession and Jesus's death. It was a **preview** of resurrection glory, but the path to that glory led through the cross.\n\n**Your transfigurations** (moments of glory, spiritual highs, answered prayers) are **previews**, not destinations. They strengthen you for the valleys ahead.\n\n**Modern application**: Don't expect constant mountaintop experiences. God gives glimpses of glory to sustain you through suffering.\n\n### 3. Listen to Jesus\n\n**\"Listen to him!\"**—the Father's command.\n\nNot to:\n\n- Religious traditions (Moses)\n\n- Prophetic movements (Elijah)\n\n- Popular opinion\n\n- Your feelings\n\n- Cultural pressure\n\nBut to **Jesus**—His words in Scripture, His Spirit's guidance, His example.\n\n**Modern application**: In a noisy world with competing voices, prioritize Jesus's words above all others. When Scripture contradicts culture, listen to Jesus.\n\n### 4. Don't Try to Capture Glory\n\nPeter wanted to **build shelters**—institutionalize and contain the experience. But God's presence can't be shrined or bottled.\n\n**The danger today**:\n\n- Building programs around past moves of God\n\n- Trying to recreate past experiences\n\n- Institutionalizing what was meant to be dynamic\n\n- Preferring the familiar over following God forward\n\n**Modern application**: Follow God's presence rather than trying to capture it. Be willing to leave past glories to pursue present purposes.\n\n### 5. Face Changes You\n\n**Moses's face shone** after encountering God (Exodus 34:29-35).\n\n**Jesus's face shone** revealing His divine nature (Matthew 17:2).\n\n**Our faces change** when we behold Him:\n\n> *\"And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory.\"* (2 Corinthians 3:18, NIV)\n\n**Modern application**: Spending time with Jesus changes you. The more you see His glory (in Scripture, worship, prayer), the more you reflect that glory.\n\n## Conclusion: The Glory That Sustains\n\n**Six days** after Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi, Jesus led three disciples up a mountain—likely [Mount Hermon](/mount-hermon-bible-meaning), rising 9,000 feet above where [the Watchers had descended](/who-are-the-watchers-the-fallen-angels-who-descended-to-earth) millennia earlier.\n\nThere, on the mountain of ancient rebellion, Jesus revealed redemptive glory.\n\n**His face shone like the sun.** His clothes became dazzling white. Moses and Elijah—the Law and the Prophets—appeared and discussed His coming \"exodus\" in Jerusalem. The Father's voice thundered from a bright cloud: **\"This is my Son. Listen to him!\"**\n\nFor Peter, James, and John, the vision seared into their memories. Decades later, Peter would write:\n\n> *\"We were eyewitnesses of his majesty. He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.' We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.\"* (2 Peter 1:16-18, NIV)\n\n**That vision sustained them** through:\n\n- Jesus's crucifixion\n\n- Peter's denial and restoration\n\n- James's martyrdom\n\n- John's exile\n\n- Decades of persecution\n\n- The long wait for Jesus's return\n\n**The Transfiguration taught them**:\n\n- Jesus's glory is real, even when hidden\n\n- Suffering is temporary; glory is coming\n\n- The Law and Prophets point to Christ\n\n- God confirms His Son's identity and mission\n\n- They would see His glory again\n\n**And it teaches us**: When the path grows dark, when the cross seems too heavy, when you question whether it's worth it—remember the mountain.\n\n**Jesus was transfigured.** The glory is real. The resurrection is certain. The kingdom is coming.\n\nAnd one day, **we will be transfigured too**:\n\n> *\"But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform [*metamorphoō*—same word as Transfiguration] our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.\"* (Philippians 3:20-21, NIV)\n\nThe glory Jesus revealed on the mountain is the glory **we will share**.\n\nSo when you're tempted to give up, remember the Transfiguration. **The glory is real.** **The promise is certain.** **Jesus has been there before you.**\n\nAnd He says: **\"Don't be afraid.\"**\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: Why did Jesus wait six days after Peter's confession before the Transfiguration?**\n\nThe \"six days\" (Matthew 17:1, Mark 9:2) connects the Transfiguration to Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi. Luke says \"about eight days\" (Luke 9:28), which is also consistent (counting inclusively or approximately). The delay may have allowed time for teaching, travel preparation, and the disciples to process Peter's confession before seeing Jesus's glory confirmed.\n\n**Q: Was the Transfiguration on Mount Hermon or Mount Tabor?**\n\nWhile church tradition since the 4th century places it on Mount Tabor, biblical evidence strongly favors Mount Hermon: (1) Jesus was at Caesarea Philippi at Hermon's base six days earlier, (2) Hermon is truly \"very high\" at 9,232 feet vs. Tabor's 1,886 feet, (3) Hermon provided privacy while Tabor had a fortress, (4) The geography and timing make more sense with Hermon.\n\n**Q: How did Moses appear if he had died 1,400 years earlier?**\n\nMoses's appearance demonstrates several truths: (1) Those who die in faith continue to exist consciously with God, (2) God can bring back even the dead for His purposes, (3) The soul survives death, (4) Resurrection and eternal life are real. Moses's presence testified that death doesn't end existence and prefigured the coming resurrection.\n\n**Q: Why did Peter want to build three shelters?**\n\nPeter likely meant well but misunderstood the situation. He may have wanted to: (1) prolong the glorious moment, (2) honor all three equally (missing Jesus's supremacy), (3) celebrate like the Feast of Tabernacles, or (4) avoid the difficult path ahead. The Gospels note he \"didn't know what to say\" (Mark 9:6) and \"didn't know what he was saying\" (Luke 9:33)—he spoke from fear and confusion.\n\n**Q: What was the \"departure\" (exodus) Moses and Elijah discussed with Jesus?**\n\nLuke 9:31 uses the Greek word *exodos* (same as Israel's Exodus from Egypt), referring to Jesus's death, resurrection, and ascension in Jerusalem. This wasn't casual conversation—they discussed the central event of history: Jesus's sacrifice that would accomplish the ultimate exodus from sin and death. The greatest Old Testament saints understood the Messiah must suffer to save.\n\n**Q: Why couldn't the disciples tell anyone until after the resurrection?**\n\nJesus commanded silence (Matthew 17:9) because: (1) People might misunderstand and try to make Him an earthly king immediately, (2) The Transfiguration only makes sense after the resurrection—it's a preview of resurrection glory, (3) The cross had to come before the crown, (4) Revealing it too soon would confuse rather than clarify His mission.\n\n**Q: What does the Transfiguration mean for Christians today?**\n\nThe Transfiguration shows: (1) Jesus's divine nature—He is God, (2) His resurrection glory—what He became after rising, (3) Our future transformation—we will be like Him (Philippians 3:20-21, 1 John 3:2), (4) The reality of eternal life—Moses and Elijah appeared alive, (5) Scripture's fulfillment—the Law and Prophets point to Christ, (6) Our need to listen to Jesus above all other voices.\n\n---\n\n*All Scripture quotations are from the New International Version (NIV) unless otherwise noted.*\n\n",
