    "raw": "\r\nMany of us have heard that the number 40 is important in the Bible, but we may wonder why it matters. **In the Bible, the number 40 often represents a time of testing, trials, and transformation.** This pattern appears in many well-known stories, and it shapes how people understand periods of waiting, struggle, and growth.\r\n\r\nWhen we read about Moses spending 40 days on Mount Sinai, the Israelites wandering in the desert for 40 years, or Jesus fasting for 40 days, we notice that the number marks a turning point. These events are more than just random lengths of time; they symbolize change and deep spiritual meaning. The repeated use of 40 shows us that transformation can come after a period of challenge.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/jEc45oUsk0Q\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the significance of 40 gives us insight into [biblical themes and stories](https://thelordsprayercreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/biblical_meaning_of_numbers.pdf) in a new way. When we see this number in the Bible, it invites us to think about the meaning behind moments of struggle and how they can lead to growth and new beginnings.\r\n\r\n## The Symbolism of the Number 40 in the Bible\r\n\r\nThe number 40 appears many times in the Bible, often signaling a special period set apart for important events or changes. Its repeated use points to a deeper meaning tied to testing, growth, and the search for [divine order](https://scripturemeanings.com/the-number-12-in-the-bible-tribes-apostles-and-gods-blueprint/).\r\n\r\n### Meaning and Significance in Biblical Numerology\r\n\r\nIn biblical numerology, the number 40 is closely linked to periods of preparation, testing, and change. We see this pattern across both the Old and New Testaments.\r\n\r\nA few key examples help us see this connection:\r\n\r\n- Moses spent forty days and nights on Mount Sinai before receiving the Ten Commandments.\r\n- Jesus fasted for forty days in the wilderness before starting His ministry.\r\n- The flood during Noah's time lasted forty days and nights.\r\n\r\nThese episodes signal important shifts for people or nations. In each, the period of forty marks a transition from one phase of life or history to another. The regular occurrence of this number gives it extra weight in biblical stories, as shown in studies about [numerical symbolism in the Bible](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arvi-Hurskainen/publication/366227249_Numerical_symbolism_in_Bible_1/links/63988392e42faa7e75bd9e22/Numerical-symbolism-in-Bible-1.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Forty as a Period of Trials and Transformation\r\n\r\nWe often find the number 40 used during times of trial, testing, and probation. In the desert, the Israelites wandered for forty years, shaped by hardship—testing their faith and preparing them to enter the Promised Land.\r\n\r\nJesus' forty-day fast was a time of deep temptation and struggle. Each period of forty in the Bible tends to be uncomfortable but brings growth or readiness. For example:\r\n\r\n- Elijah traveled forty days to Horeb, the mountain of God, during his spiritual struggle.\r\n- The spies scouted the land of Canaan for forty days, testing the people's trust in God.\r\n\r\nThis pattern shows us how 'forty' functions as a meaningful span that allows for personal or communal transformation before something new or greater occurs.\r\n\r\n### Symbolic Connections to Order and Divine Perfection\r\n\r\nBesides representing trial, the number 40 is also believed to point to ideas of order and divine perfection. Biblical writers sometimes use numbers like forty to show that God is working out His purposeful plan through stages of discipline and growth.\r\n\r\nIn some views, forty is seen as a complete period designed by God to bring about maturity or fulfillment, pointing to [order and divine intention](https://thelordsprayercreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/biblical_meaning_of_numbers.pdf). This sense of order is not by chance; it's woven into the fabric of the stories.\r\n\r\nBy ending these forty-day or forty-year spans, there is a sense that the time set by God has been fulfilled, and a new, ordered phase can begin. This understanding connects the themes of probation, growth, and divine order in biblical history.\r\n\r\n## Old Testament Instances of the Number 40\r\n\r\nThe number 40 appears in several key moments throughout the Old Testament. These events often involve times of trial, testing, and change for important biblical figures and the people of Israel.\r\n\r\n### The Forty Days and Nights of the Flood\r\n\r\nIn Genesis 7:12, the [flood](https://scripturemeanings.com/dreams-of-water-in-the-bible-from-noah-to-revelation/) sent by God covered the earth with rain for forty days and forty nights. This was a time of judgment but also of new beginnings. All life, except those in the ark with Noah, was wiped from the earth.\r\n\r\nAfter the rain stopped, Noah, his family, and the animals with him waited in the ark for the waters to go down. The forty days were not just about destruction—they marked a turning point for creation, with a promise of deliverance. The number 40 here highlights God's power to start anew after a time of deep trial.\r\n\r\nFor more on the significance of numbers in the Old Testament, see the article from [Gospel Studies UK](http://biblicalstudies.gospelstudies.org.uk/pdf/tp/numbers_wenham.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Moses on Mount Sinai: Receiving the Ten Commandments\r\n\r\nMoses spent forty days and forty nights on Mount Sinai, as described in Exodus 24:18 and Exodus 34:28. During this time, he neither ate bread nor drank water. While Moses was alone with God, he received the Ten Commandments for the people of Israel.\r\n\r\nThis period stands out as a time of intense preparation, communication, and reflection. Moses' experience shows us that 40 days can be a period for receiving guidance and wisdom.\r\n\r\nMoses' stay on Sinai led to the formation of the nation's laws. This moment transformed the relationship between Israel and God, laying the foundation for living as His people.\r\n\r\n### Israelites' Forty Years in the Wilderness\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Egypt, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years before reaching the promised land. The reason for this long journey was their lack of faith and disobedience, as explained in the book of Deuteronomy.\r\n\r\nTheir forty years in the wilderness became a time of testing, learning, and transformation. The people depended on God for daily food, water, and direction. It was also a time when an entire generation passed away, and a new generation was prepared to enter the promised land.\r\n\r\nThis journey reminds us that obedience and trust are important, and that transformation often comes through perseverance.\r\n\r\nTo read more about the meaning of numbers in the Bible, especially 40, visit [The Lord's Prayer Creed](https://thelordsprayercreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/biblical_meaning_of_numbers.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Elijah's Forty-Day Journey to Mount Horeb\r\n\r\nAfter fleeing from Queen Jezebel, the prophet Elijah traveled for forty days and forty nights to reach Mount Horeb, according to 1 Kings 19:8. This journey was made possible after an angel provided food and water for him. Elijah was exhausted and discouraged, but God sustained him for the trip.\r\n\r\nMount Horeb, also known as Sinai, was a special place where Elijah experienced God's presence and received renewed purpose. The forty-day journey marked a time of spiritual renewal following a period of fear and despair.\r\n\r\nElijah's experience, like those of Moses and the Israelites, shows how forty days can represent a path through difficulty to a place of encounter and change.\r\n\r\n## New Testament Experiences with the Number 40\r\n\r\nThe [number 40](https://scripturemeanings.com/33-a-lucky-number-in-the-bible/) is connected to important events in the New Testament. It marks times when Jesus Christ, his disciples, and early believers faced trials, change, and growth in faith.\r\n\r\n### Jesus' Forty Days of Temptation and Fasting\r\n\r\nAfter his baptism, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness. For forty days, he fasted without food and faced temptation from Satan. Both Matthew 4:2 and Luke 4:2 record this event.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Jesus prayed and resisted each temptation, using scripture to answer Satan. Fasting for 40 days not only showed his discipline but also prepared him for his ministry. These forty days tested Jesus' commitment to God and helped him show complete trust in the Father.\r\n\r\nHis victory over temptation inspires us to stay strong during our own trials. This period of fasting is seen as a time that shaped Jesus for the gospel work ahead and is a key example in the New Testament of spiritual endurance.\r\n\r\n### The Resurrection to Ascension: Forty Days with the Disciples\r\n\r\nAfter Jesus' resurrection from the dead, he appeared to his disciples and others over a period of forty days. Acts 1:3 explains that Jesus gave many convincing proofs of his resurrection during this time.\r\n\r\nFor forty days, he spoke about the kingdom of God and prepared the disciples for their new mission. They learned directly from Jesus, asked questions, and gained a clearer understanding of the gospel of Christ.\r\n\r\nThis time between the resurrection and ascension was important for building the disciples' faith. It gave them the confidence to spread the message about Jesus to the world after he ascended into heaven.\r\n\r\n### Other Significant References\r\n\r\nOutside these two major events, the number 40 is less common in the New Testament. However, the pattern still appears in teachings about prayer, patience, and waiting on God.\r\n\r\nFor example, Jesus often spent extended periods in solitary prayer, though not always for forty days. The idea of forty days remains a symbol for many Christians, especially during Lent, a 40-day season of reflection leading up to Easter, modeled after Jesus' fasting.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament uses the number 40 to point us toward persistence and transformation through faith trials, even when the stories do not mention it directly. For more background on biblical numbers, see the overview in this [study on biblical numbers](https://thelordsprayercreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/biblical_meaning_of_numbers.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Forty as a Period of Testing and Trial\r\n\r\nThroughout the Bible, the number 40 often marks times of testing, hardship, and transformation. These stories and themes teach us about overcoming difficulty through faith, obedience, and personal change.\r\n\r\n### Biblical Examples of Trials and Overcoming Hardship\r\n\r\nThe Bible contains many events where periods of 40 days or 40 years represent trials and challenges. Moses spent 40 days and nights on Mount Sinai, fasting and receiving the commandments. The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, growing through struggle before reaching the Promised Land. Jesus fasted for 40 days in the wilderness, facing temptations before starting his ministry.\r\n\r\nEach story shares a pattern: God's people face hardship, are tested, and come out changed. These events show us that times of trial are not just punishment; they are also opportunities for learning and transformation. The pattern of 40 as a period of testing can also be found in [other biblical accounts](https://brill.com/downloadpdf/display/book/edcoll/9789004275119/B9789004275119-s004.pdf).\r\n\r\n### The Themes of Redemption, Repentance, and Spiritual Growth\r\n\r\nSeasons of testing linked to the number 40 often lead to repentance and redemption. After their disobedience, the Israelites' 40 years in the desert gave them time to repent and learn to trust God. Jonah warned Nineveh of destruction and the city had 40 days to repent, leading to their deliverance.\r\n\r\nThese stories reveal that testing can bring [spiritual growth](https://scripturemeanings.com/the-number-7-in-the-bible-beyond-perfection-whats-the-real-story/). Hard times encourage us to look inward, admit our faults, and seek forgiveness. This idea is not just in ancient stories, but shapes how we understand spiritual growth and redemption today.\r\n\r\nA quick table to summarize some **key examples**:\r\n\r\n<table className=\"w-full border-collapse my-6\">\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr className=\"border-b-2 border-gray-300\">\r\n      <th className=\"text-left p-3 font-semibold\">Person/Group</th>\r\n      <th className=\"text-left p-3 font-semibold\">Length</th>\r\n      <th className=\"text-left p-3 font-semibold\">Result</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr className=\"border-b border-gray-200\">\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Moses</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">40 days</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Receives Law, brings it to Israel</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr className=\"border-b border-gray-200\">\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Israelites</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">40 years</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Repentance, entry into Promised Land</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr className=\"border-b border-gray-200\">\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Jesus</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">40 days</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Overcomes temptation, ready for ministry</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr className=\"border-b border-gray-200\">\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Ninevites</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">40 days warning</td>\r\n      <td className=\"p-3\">Repentance, city spared</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### The Role of Faith and Obedience\r\n\r\nFaith and obedience are central to overcoming Biblical trials connected with the number 40. In each account, the tested person or group is called to trust God and follow His instructions, even when it is difficult or unclear.\r\n\r\nFor example, Moses had to rely on God to lead the Israelites through the desert. Jesus' obedience during his fasting prepared him for his mission. When the people of Nineveh listened to Jonah and repented, they experienced salvation instead of destruction.\r\n\r\nPeriods of testing underline the importance of staying faithful and obedient, even under pressure. These lessons encourage us to keep trust and follow God's path during our own hardships and times of uncertainty. Lessons from these examples show the [lasting impact](https://books.google.com/books?hl=lt&lr=&id=g4jjpESG2xIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=Forty+as+a+Period+of+Testing+and+Trial+Biblical+Significance+of+the+Number+40:+Trials+and+Transformation+&ots=4jY16kur5t&sig=LPX_0zSkYK1r9vWH0nnrdKT8peI) of faith during trials.\r\n\r\n## Key Figures and Stories Associated with Forty\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the Bible, the number forty appears often in stories of challenge, change, and hope. This number connects leaders, prophecies, and major events, all focused on testing faith and bringing transformation.\r\n\r\n### Moses: Leader Through the Desert\r\n\r\nMoses is one of the most well-known leaders in the Old Testament. He spent forty years in Egypt, forty years in Midian, and then led the Israelites for forty years in the desert. During this time, the Israelites wandered because they failed to trust God after their escape from Egypt.\r\n\r\nWhile on Mount Sinai, Moses also spent forty days and nights speaking with God and receiving the Ten Commandments, showing a period of deep spiritual transformation. These forty-year and forty-day time frames helped prepare both Moses and the Israelites for a new beginning. According to [The Book of Numbers](https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&lr=&id=G8yAEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP12), this was a time of testing, learning, and change.\r\n\r\n**Key Moments:**\r\n\r\n- Forty years in the wilderness\r\n- Forty days on Mount Sinai\r\n- Guiding a people through trial and growth\r\n\r\n### Elijah and His Prophetic Journey\r\n\r\nThe prophet Elijah faced many hardships as he delivered God's message to Israel. After a dramatic victory over the prophets of Baal, Elijah fled into the wilderness to escape Queen Jezebel's anger.\r\n\r\nElijah traveled for forty days and nights to Mount Horeb, sometimes called Sinai, where he experienced God's presence in a quiet whisper. This journey symbolized the physical and spiritual distance he had to cross to find renewed strength and guidance. Elijah's story highlights the value of endurance during difficult times, marking forty days as a period of seeking and transformation. His journey mirrors Moses' own experiences in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n**Important Details:**\r\n\r\n- Forty days and nights of travel\r\n- A search for meaning and renewal\r\n- Encounters with God in moments of solitude\r\n\r\n### Jonah's Message to Nineveh\r\n\r\nJonah is sent to warn the city of Nineveh that it will be destroyed in forty days unless the people repent. In [Jonah 3:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah+3%3A4&version=NIV), Jonah's simple message sparks a surprising reaction: the people of Nineveh quickly turn from their evil ways.\r\n\r\nThe number forty marks both a countdown and a window of opportunity. The people's repentance leads to mercy instead of destruction, showing that these forty days are not only about punishment but also about the chance for transformation. Jonah's story demonstrates how a clear warning and a set time frame can bring about meaningful change.\r\n\r\n**Key Points:**\r\n\r\n- Jonah's warning of forty days\r\n- Nineveh's citywide repentance\r\n- Transformation through heeding prophetic messages\r\n\r\n### David's Reign and Triumph over Goliath\r\n\r\nDavid stands out as both a shepherd and a king. His most famous moment as a young man was defeating the Philistine giant [Goliath](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+17&version=NIV), who taunted the armies of Israel for forty days (1 Samuel 17). David's courage ended the challenge and inspired Israel.\r\n\r\nLater, David would reign as king for forty years. Both the battle with Goliath and his reign highlight how the pattern of forty often surrounds times of trial, testing, and victory. Through these periods, David grew as a leader and fulfilled prophecies given to Israel.\r\n\r\n**Notable Aspects:**\r\n\r\n- Goliath's forty-day challenge\r\n- David's response and victory\r\n- Forty years as king over Israel and Judah\r\n\r\n## Theological Interpretations of Forty\r\n\r\nThe number forty often marks important periods of testing, preparation, and change in the Bible. These moments are not random; they reveal deep patterns for understanding [redemption](https://scripturemeanings.com/elioud-in-the-bible-ancient-lineage-explored-in-sacred-texts/), [God's promises](https://scripturemeanings.com/the-number-9-in-the-bible/), and the ways divine mercy and grace work in the story of salvation.\r\n\r\n### Fulfillment and the Promise of Redemption\r\n\r\nWe see the number forty connected with the theme of redemption and fulfillment throughout the Bible. For example, the Israelites wandered in the desert for forty years, marking a complete period of dependence on God before entering the Promised Land. This journey wasn't just about trials; it was about fulfilling God's promise and preparing the people for a new beginning.\r\n\r\nMoses spent [forty days on Mount Sinai](https://thelordsprayercreed.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/biblical_meaning_of_numbers.pdf) getting the law, which shows a link to fulfillment as well as the giving of the covenant. Elijah also spent forty days traveling to Mount Horeb after facing despair, finding new purpose and hope.\r\n\r\nWe see the pattern of forty in the life of Jesus, who fasted for forty days in the desert before starting his public ministry. His trial ended with the promise of redemption and the message of salvation. In each of these cases, the period of forty is tied to hope, fulfillment, and God keeping his promises.\r\n\r\n### Forty as Preparation for Divine Revelation\r\n\r\nForty also prepares God's people for a greater revelation. When Moses was alone with God for forty days, he received the Ten Commandments—fundamental laws that shaped Israel's moral and spiritual life. These laws formed the basis for what would later become part of the \"book of life\" for those seeking eternal life and salvation.\r\n\r\nAfter the resurrection, Jesus appeared to his followers for forty days, teaching about the kingdom of God and preparing them for the coming of the Holy Spirit. This period was not just waiting; it was filled with learning and new understanding.\r\n\r\nThese patterns show that forty is a set time for God's people to receive knowledge or direction. Divine revelation often follows a season marked by forty, leading to deeper faith and greater insight about the Trinity and God's plan.\r\n\r\n### Judgment, Mercy, and Grace\r\n\r\nThe time of forty is also connected to judgment, but it is always balanced with mercy and grace. The flood in Noah's day lasted for forty days and nights, representing judgment on the earth. Yet, after the flood, God promised mercy and set a sign of grace with the rainbow.\r\n\r\nNineveh was given a warning of forty days to repent before destruction. This brief window allowed for mercy when the people turned from their ways, and God withheld his judgment. We see in these examples that forty is not simply about punishment, but about the chance for redemption and new life.\r\n\r\nThis cycle of judgment and forgiveness highlights the ongoing themes of salvation and God's desire to restore. The number forty stands as a symbol for both the seriousness of sin under the law and the generous offer of grace that comes with repentance.\r\n\r\n## The Number 40 in Christian Practice and Tradition\r\n\r\nThe number 40 is linked to important rituals and seasons in Christianity. These practices often symbolize change, preparation, and [spiritual focus](https://scripturemeanings.com/the-hidden-meaning-of-biblical-colors-what-gold-purple-and-scarlet-reveal/) by setting aside forty days marked by prayer, sacrifice, or celebration.\r\n\r\n### Lent: Forty Days of Fasting and Reflection\r\n\r\nDuring Lent, we observe forty days of fasting, prayer, and self-examination. This period reminds us of Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness, facing temptation before starting His ministry.\r\n\r\nMany Christians give up certain foods or activities as a form of discipline. Weekly worship, special prayers, and [acts of charity](https://scripturemeanings.com/prayer-journal-for-women-52-week-a-must-have-for-faith/) are common practices. Sundays are often seen as \"feast days,\" so they are not counted in the forty days.\r\n\r\nThe length of Lent encourages personal transformation. We are invited to let go of old habits and focus on what truly matters. For a detailed look at Lent's origins and structure, read about the meaning and role of [forty days in biblical tradition](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540261.2020.1769289).\r\n\r\n### Easter and the Ascension\r\n\r\nEaster follows the forty days of Lent and celebrates the resurrection of Jesus. This joyful day marks victory over death and the promise of new life.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter, there is another period of forty days before the Ascension. According to the Bible, Jesus appeared to His followers for forty days after He rose from the dead. These forty days allowed the disciples to learn, witness, and prepare for carrying Jesus' message to others.\r\n\r\nThe Ascension occurs on the fortieth day after Easter. It is celebrated as the day Jesus returned to heaven. This timeline connects the key Christian events of sacrifice, renewal, and commissioning through the use of the number forty.\r\n\r\n### Advent, Prayer, and Modern Applications\r\n\r\nAdvent is a time of waiting and preparation before Christmas, though it does not last exactly forty days. Still, many churches use periods of forty days to focus on prayer, mission work, or personal growth outside main liturgical seasons.\r\n\r\nIn our daily practice, the number 40 often inspires us to set aside special periods for Bible study, giving, or fasting. Some believers join in forty-day prayer challenges or devotionals, drawing on the biblical significance of [forty as a time of testing and spiritual change](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540261.2020.1769289).\r\n\r\nThe tradition of associating the number 40 with transformation and dedication continues to guide us in various ways, both in church seasons and personal faith journeys.\r\n\r\n## Spiritual Lessons and Lasting Impact\r\n\r\nWhen we explore the number 40 in scripture, it becomes clear that this number is deeply tied to [spiritual truth](https://scripturemeanings.com/the-hidden-power-of-12-in-the-bible-a-personal-journey-of-discovery/), the process of sanctification, and major changes in our lives. Our understanding grows as we reflect on these biblical events and consider how they relate to our own faith journey.\r\n\r\n### Transformation Through Trials\r\n\r\nThe number 40 often marks times of trial or testing. For example, the Israelites spent 40 years in the wilderness, Moses fasted for 40 days on Mount Sinai, and Jesus was tempted for 40 days in the desert. These moments were difficult, but each brought about a significant change in those involved.\r\n\r\nThrough these trials, people were shaped and prepared for new purposes. We see that challenges can refine our character and test our faith. In facing hardship and uncertainty, we learn to rely on God rather than ourselves.\r\n\r\nSpiritual truth often becomes clearer in hard times. When we look back at these stories, we find examples of how God uses trials to bring about transformation. We are reminded that enduring difficulties can lead to growth and new beginnings.\r\n\r\n### Sanctification and Growth in Faith\r\n\r\nSpiritual growth and sanctification often happen over time, not instantly. In scripture, periods of 40 days or years symbolize a process where faith is tested and made stronger. As we walk through trials, we gain patience, wisdom, and a deeper relationship with God.\r\n\r\nThe story of Noah and the flood, which lasted 40 days, and Elijah's 40-day journey to Mount Horeb, both highlight this point. Each required trust and obedience. These periods allowed for reflection, repentance, and unity with God's purpose.\r\n\r\n_Key spiritual outcomes:_\r\n\r\n- Long-term commitment to God\r\n- Increased understanding of His will\r\n- Stronger sense of unity with others\r\n- Growth in our relationships and ability to forgive\r\n\r\nThese stories show us that our faith grows through day-to-day choices and lessons learned in tough moments. Transformation is not just about overcoming, but about becoming more like Christ.\r\n\r\n### Opportunities, Freedom, and New Beginnings\r\n\r\nThe end of a 40-day or 40-year period in the Bible almost always signals a new beginning. For example, after wandering in the wilderness for 40 years, the Israelites entered the Promised Land. This new chapter brought hope, victory, and freedom from past burdens.\r\n\r\nPeriods marked by the number 40 lead to opportunities for change and to follow God's calling. God often uses these times to offer us a fresh start, an open door, or restored relationships. Our humanity and need for grace are highlighted, along with the possibility of miracles.\r\n\r\nWe see in these stories that after enduring trials, we are given the chance to begin again, and to walk forward with renewed faith and purpose.
