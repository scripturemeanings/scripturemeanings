    "raw": "\nWater floods our dreams—rivers, storms, waves. It’s no surprise, then, that scripture brims with watery visions, each rippling with meaning. From Noah’s deluge to the river of life in Revelation, water isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a messenger. Let’s wade into its depths and see what God’s saying.\n\nNoah’s flood (Genesis 6-9) drowns a corrupted world, but it also lifts the ark—a brutal cleansing that births hope.\n\n![moses parts the red sea](images/moses-parts-the-red-sea-796x1024.webp)\n\nMoses parts the Red Sea (Exodus 14), turning water into a wall of deliverance, chaos harnessed for freedom. Jesus walks on it (Matthew 14:25), defying its power, while baptism sinks us into it for rebirth (Romans 6:4). By Revelation 22, water flows crystal-clear from God’s throne, no longer a threat but a gift.\n\nWater shifts—destroyer, divider, sustainer. It’s chaos God tames, a mirror of our messy souls. Dreams of drowning might echo Noah; dreams of crossing might whisper Moses. Scripture shows water as God’s tool to unmake and remake us. Even the Spirit hovered over it at creation (Genesis 1:2), hinting at its wild holiness.\n\nTakeaway: What water fills your dreams? A storm to survive or a stream to drink from? Scripture says it’s rarely random—God’s speaking through the waves. Listen.\n",
