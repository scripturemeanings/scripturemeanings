Whether your teeth are crumbling, falling out one by one, breaking apart, or simply gone when you look in the mirror, these dreams can leave you feeling vulnerable, anxious, and searching for meaning. But what does the Bible say about teeth in dreams, and what spiritual significance might these unsettling experiences carry?\n\nThe biblical meaning of teeth falling out in dreams typically represents **loss of power, inability to speak truth, fear of losing influence, spiritual attack on your authority, or warning about controlling your words**. While disturbing to experience, these dreams often serve as divine alerts—God revealing areas of spiritual weakness, calling you to guard your speech, or showing you where your power and influence are being compromised.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the biblical symbolism of teeth, examine what Scripture reveals about speech and power, understand different variations of teeth-falling-out dreams, and discover how to discern what God might be communicating through these anxiety-producing but spiritually significant dreams.\n\n## The Biblical Foundation of Teeth Symbolism\n\n### Teeth as Instruments of Power\n\nThroughout Scripture, teeth symbolize strength, power, and the ability to overcome enemies:\n\n**Psalm 3:7** connects teeth with enemy defeat:\n> \"Arise, LORD! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.\"\n\nDavid's prayer equates breaking enemies' teeth with removing their power to harm. When you dream of your own teeth falling out, it may represent feelings of powerlessness or actual spiritual attack aimed at neutralizing your effectiveness.\n\n**Job 29:17** describes Job's righteous power:\n> \"I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.\"\n\nJob's testimony shows teeth representing the power to oppress or rescue. Losing teeth in dreams might indicate losing your ability to defend others or resist evil.\n\n**Proverbs 30:14** warns of destructive power:\n> \"There are those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth.\"\n\nTeeth symbolize the power to harm or help. Dreams of teeth problems may reveal how you're using (or misusing) your influence and authority.\n\n### Teeth and Speech\n\nTeeth are essential for clear speech—and the Bible emphasizes the power of words:\n\n**Proverbs 18:21** declares:\n> \"The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.\"\n\nYour teeth enable speech, and speech carries creative power. Dreams of losing teeth often represent fear of losing your voice, inability to communicate effectively, or conviction about words you've spoken.\n\n**James 3:3-6** compares the tongue to powerful instruments:\n> \"When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example... they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.\"\n\nTeeth work with the tongue in speech. Losing teeth in dreams may symbolize losing control of your words or the consequences of destructive speech.\n\n**Matthew 12:36-37** emphasizes word accountability:\n> \"But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n\nDreams about teeth may serve as warnings to guard your speech, recognizing the eternal weight of your words.\n\n### Gnashing of Teeth - Judgment and Anguish\n\nOne of the most sobering uses of teeth imagery in Scripture relates to judgment:\n\n**Matthew 13:41-42** describes the fate of the wicked:\n> \"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"\n\n\"Gnashing of teeth\" appears repeatedly in Jesus' teachings about judgment, representing extreme anguish and regret. While teeth-falling-out dreams differ from gnashing, they may still carry warning elements about spiritual condition or coming consequences.\n\n## Common Biblical Meanings of Teeth Falling Out in Dreams\n\n### 1. Loss of Spiritual Power and Authority\n\nLosing teeth in dreams often represents **loss of spiritual effectiveness, authority, or influence** in your life or ministry.\n\n**Luke 10:19** promises spiritual authority:\n> \"I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\"\n\n**Dream Interpretation:**\n- Feeling powerless in spiritual battles or life circumstances\n- Loss of confidence in your calling or gifting\n- Spiritual attack designed to neutralize your effectiveness\n- Fear of losing influence or impact in ministry or relationships\n\nIf you're experiencing spiritual warfare or questioning your effectiveness, teeth-falling-out dreams may visualize these internal struggles.\n\n### 2. Fear of Loss of Voice or Influence\n\nDreams of losing teeth frequently represent **anxiety about losing your ability to speak truth, influence others, or be heard**.\n\n**Ezekiel 3:26-27** describes temporary loss of speech:\n> \"I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them... But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'\"\n\n**Dream Interpretation:**\n- Fear that people aren't listening to you or valuing your input\n- Anxiety about losing platform, audience, or sphere of influence\n- Concern that your message is being silenced or ignored\n- Frustration over inability to express yourself effectively\n\nIf you're struggling to be heard or fearing loss of influence, these dreams may reflect those anxieties.\n\n### 3. Warning About Destructive or Careless Words\n\nTeeth dreams can serve as **divine warnings about how you're using your speech—whether gossiping, lying, or speaking carelessly**.\n\n**Proverbs 12:18** contrasts healing and harmful words:\n> \"The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.\"\n\n**Dream Interpretation:**\n- Conviction about gossip, slander, or critical speech\n- Warning that your words are destroying relationships\n- Call to repentance for lying or deceptive communication\n- Alert that careless words are having consequences\n\nIf you've been speaking carelessly or destructively, God may use teeth dreams to warn you before greater consequences manifest.\n\n### 4. Spiritual Weakness or Compromise\n\nTeeth falling out can symbolize **spiritual decay, compromise, or gradual weakening** of faith and conviction.\n\n**1 Corinthians 3:1-2** addresses spiritual immaturity:\n> \"Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it.\"\n\nTeeth enable eating solid food. Losing them may represent spiritual immaturity or inability to digest \"solid food\" of mature faith.\n\n**Dream Interpretation:**\n- Spiritual compromise weakening your foundation\n- Inability to handle mature spiritual truths\n- Backsliding or drifting from close walk with God\n- Loss of spiritual discernment or conviction\n\nIf you recognize spiritual weakness or compromise, these dreams may be God's wake-up call to strengthen your foundation.\n\n### 5. Anxiety and Fear of Inadequacy\n\nSometimes teeth dreams simply represent **deep anxiety, fear of failure, or feelings of inadequacy**—though even these can have spiritual roots.\n\n**Philippians 4:6-7** addresses anxiety:\n> \"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\"\n\n**Dream Interpretation:**\n- General anxiety about life circumstances or future\n- Fear of inadequacy in calling, relationships, or responsibilities\n- Stress about aging, appearance, or declining abilities\n- Worry about things falling apart in your life\n\nEven when teeth dreams stem from natural anxiety, God can use them to draw you into deeper trust and peace in Him.\n\n## Types of Teeth Dreams and Their Meanings\n\n### Teeth Falling Out One by One\n\n**Dream Scenario:** Your teeth fall out individually—sometimes you can feel them loosening, then falling out one after another.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Gradual Loss of Power or Influence**\n- Slowly losing effectiveness in ministry or calling\n- Influence diminishing over time without your realizing\n- Incremental spiritual decline rather than sudden fall\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough\"* (Galatians 5:9) - Small compromises lead to larger losses\n\n**2. Sequential Losses or Disappointments**\n- One difficulty following another in succession\n- Multiple losses happening gradually\n- Feeling like life is slowly falling apart\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed\"* (2 Corinthians 4:8)\n\n**Application:** Examine whether you're experiencing gradual spiritual decline or sequential challenges. Ask God to reveal root issues and strengthen areas of weakness.\n\n### Teeth Crumbling or Disintegrating\n\n**Dream Scenario:** Your teeth crumble into pieces, turn to dust, or disintegrate in your mouth.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Foundation Cracking Under Pressure**\n- Your spiritual foundation isn't as solid as you thought\n- Life pressures exposing weaknesses in your faith\n- Structure of your life crumbling under stress\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever\"* (Proverbs 10:25)\n\n**2. Corrupt Foundation Needing Rebuilding**\n- Areas built on wrong foundations (pride, self-reliance, worldly wisdom)\n- God allowing false foundations to crumble so He can rebuild on truth\n- Necessary destruction before proper reconstruction\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain\"* (Psalm 127:1)\n\n**Application:** Examine your foundations. Are you built on Christ or on shifting sand? Allow God to rebuild properly, even if it means current structures must fall.\n\n### Teeth Breaking or Shattering\n\n**Dream Scenario:** Your teeth break—sometimes biting down causes them to shatter, or they break while eating.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Trying to \"Chew\" What You Can't Handle**\n- Taking on responsibilities or challenges beyond your current capacity\n- Attempting to process spiritual truths you're not mature enough for\n- Biting off more than you can chew in ministry or life\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child\"* (1 Corinthians 13:11)\n\n**2. Impact of Hardened Words or Attitudes**\n- Bitterness, unforgiveness, or hardness of heart breaking you\n- Grinding teeth represents anger, resentment, or stress\n- Internal hardness causing external breaking\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger\"* (Ephesians 4:31)\n\n**Application:** Evaluate what you're trying to process or accomplish. Are you overextending? Are there hard heart issues causing internal damage?\n\n### All Teeth Gone - Complete Loss\n\n**Dream Scenario:** You discover all your teeth are gone—your mouth is completely empty.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Complete Loss of Voice or Influence**\n- Total inability to speak truth or be heard\n- Complete loss of platform, ministry, or influence\n- Feeling utterly powerless and voiceless\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"I will not keep silent, because of Zion I will not remain quiet\"* (Isaiah 62:1) contrasted with feeling unable to speak\n\n**2. Total Surrender and Dependence**\n- Stripping away all ability to defend yourself\n- Complete reliance on God rather than your own power\n- Season of silence before God restores voice\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness\"* (2 Corinthians 12:9)\n\n**Application:** If experiencing complete loss, ask whether God is calling you to deeper dependence or showing you the results of gradual compromise. Seek restoration through repentance and renewal.\n\n### Teeth Growing Back or Being Replaced\n\n**Dream Scenario:** After losing teeth, new ones begin growing back, or you receive replacement teeth.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Restoration After Loss**\n- God restoring what was lost or stolen\n- Renewal of power, voice, or influence after season of loss\n- Redemption and resurrection after \"death\"\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten\"* (Joel 2:25, KJV)\n\n**2. Transformation and Upgrade**\n- God replacing old methods, speech patterns, or authority with new\n- Spiritual maturity replacing childish ways\n- Divine upgrade after necessary loss\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"The old has gone, the new is here!\"* (2 Corinthians 5:17)\n\n**Application:** Rejoice in God's restoration! Receive new strength, voice, or authority He's providing, and use it wisely.\n\n### Teeth Rotting or Decaying\n\n**Dream Scenario:** Your teeth are visibly rotting, decaying, or diseased before they fall out.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Sin or Compromise Causing Spiritual Decay**\n- Hidden sin gradually destroying spiritual health\n- Compromise slowly rotting your foundation\n- Neglect causing deterioration\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—and poverty will come on you like a thief\"* (Proverbs 6:10-11)\n\n**2. Toxic Words or Attitudes Poisoning Your Life**\n- Bitterness, gossip, or negative speech poisoning your spirit\n- Critical attitudes rotting relationships and influence\n- Internal toxicity manifesting externally\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up\"* (Ephesians 4:29)\n\n**Application:** Identify sources of spiritual decay. Repent of hidden sins, address toxic attitudes, and pursue holiness and health in all areas.\n\n### Pulling Out Your Own Teeth\n\n**Dream Scenario:** You're actively pulling out your own teeth—sometimes easily, sometimes painfully.\n\n**Spiritual Interpretations:**\n\n**1. Self-Sabotage or Self-Destruction**\n- Undermining your own ministry, relationships, or success\n- Self-destructive patterns destroying what God is building\n- Insecurity leading you to disqualify yourself\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy\"* (John 10:10) - sometimes the thief is your own negative thoughts\n\n**2. Removing What Needs to Go**\n- Actively releasing old patterns, relationships, or beliefs\n- Necessary pruning for greater fruitfulness\n- Painful but needed removal of what no longer serves God's purposes\n\n**Biblical Principle:** *\"Every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful\"* (John 15:2)\n\n**Application:** Discern whether you're self-sabotaging or appropriately pruning. If sabotaging, address root insecurity and fear. If pruning, trust God's process even when painful.\n\n## Spiritual Warnings in Teeth Dreams\n\nTeeth dreams often serve as divine warnings requiring immediate attention:\n\n### Warning #1: Guard Your Words\n\n**Proverbs 21:23** cautions:\n> \"Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity.\"\n\n**Signs This Applies:**\n- You've been gossiping, criticizing, or speaking carelessly\n- Words spoken in anger have damaged relationships\n- You're lying or being deceptive in communication\n- Sarcasm or \"jokes\" are hurting people\n\n**Response:** Immediately begin guarding your speech. Repent of destructive words, ask forgiveness where needed, and commit to speaking life and truth.\n\n### Warning #2: Address Spiritual Compromise\n\n**Revelation 3:15-16** contains Jesus' sobering warning:\n> \"I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.\"\n\n**Signs This Applies:**\n- You've been compromising convictions or standards\n- Spiritual passion and zeal have cooled\n- You're \"playing Christian\" but not truly following Christ\n- Sin you once resisted is now acceptable to you\n\n**Response:** Recognize spiritual compromise as serious danger. Repent thoroughly, remove sources of temptation, and pursue renewed passion for God.\n\n### Warning #3: Strengthen Before Complete Loss\n\n**Revelation 3:2** urges:\n> \"Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die.\"\n\n**Signs This Applies:**\n- You recognize gradual spiritual decline\n- What once was strong now feels weak\n- Spiritual disciplines have been neglected\n- Intimacy with God has faded\n\n**Response:** Take immediate action to strengthen your spiritual life before complete loss occurs. Return to prayer, Scripture, and close walk with God.\n\n## How to Respond to Teeth Dreams\n\n### 1. Record and Reflect Immediately\n\n**Immediate Action:**\n- Write the dream down with all details\n- Note which teeth were affected and how\n- Record emotions felt during and after the dream\n- Include any words, symbols, or people present\n\n**Why It Matters:** Details fade quickly, but specific elements may hold interpretive keys.\n\n### 2. Examine Your Speech\n\n**Self-Evaluation:**\n- Have you been gossiping or critical?\n- Are you lying or being deceptive?\n- Have angry words damaged relationships?\n- Is your speech building up or tearing down?\n\n**Biblical Standard:** *\"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs\"* (Ephesians 4:29)\n\n**Prayer:**\n> \"Set a guard over my mouth, LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips\" (Psalm 141:3)\n\n### 3. Assess Your Spiritual Power\n\n**Honest Questions:**\n- Do you feel powerless in spiritual battles?\n- Has your influence or effectiveness diminished?\n- Are you walking in the authority Christ gave you?\n- Have you compromised convictions that weakened you?\n\n**Biblical Truth:** *\"I can do all this through him who gives me strength\"* (Philippians 4:13)\n\n**Action:** Identify sources of powerlessness. Address spiritual warfare, repent of compromise, and reclaim authority in Christ.\n\n### 4. Check for Hidden Sin or Decay\n\n**Searching Prayer:**\n> \"Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting\" (Psalm 139:23-24)\n\n**Areas to Examine:**\n- Hidden sins not yet confessed\n- Compromises you've rationalized\n- Bitterness or unforgiveness harbored\n- Pride or self-reliance replacing dependence on God\n\n### 5. Seek Restoration and Renewal\n\n**Restoration Prayer:**\n- Ask God to restore what's been lost\n- Pray for renewed power and spiritual authority\n- Request healing for damaged relationships\n- Seek fresh baptism of Holy Spirit's power\n\n**Biblical Promise:** *\"He restores my soul\"* (Psalm 23:3)\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- Confess specific sins and receive forgiveness\n- Make restitution where needed\n- Establish spiritual disciplines\n- Surround yourself with accountability\n\n### 6. Move from Fear to Faith\n\n**Address Anxiety:**\nIf teeth dreams stem from general anxiety rather than specific spiritual issues:\n- Bring every anxiety to God in prayer (Philippians 4:6)\n- Stand on promises of His provision and care\n- Reject fear and embrace faith\n- Speak truth over anxious thoughts\n\n**Biblical Truth:** *\"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind\"* (2 Timothy 1:7, NKJV)\n\n## Biblical Examples of Power and Speech\n\nUnderstanding how Scripture portrays power and speech helps interpret teeth dreams:\n\n### Samson - Power Lost Through Compromise\n\n**Judges 16:17-20** records Samson's devastating loss:\n> \"No razor has ever been used on my head,\" he said, \"because I have been a Nazirite... If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.\"\n\nSamson's gradual compromise led to catastrophic power loss—exactly what teeth dreams often warn about.\n\n**Application:** Small compromises lead to major losses. Address spiritual compromise before you lose your power and effectiveness.\n\n### Peter - Speech Failure and Restoration\n\n**Luke 22:54-62** describes Peter's denial:\nThree times Peter denied knowing Jesus—his speech (or refusal to speak truth) represented ultimate failure of his calling.\n\n**John 21:15-17** shows Jesus' restoration:\nThree times Jesus asked \"Do you love me?\" restoring Peter's voice and calling.\n\n**Application:** If you've failed in speech or courage, Jesus offers restoration. Receive His forgiveness and renewed commission.\n\n### Isaiah - Unclean Lips Cleansed\n\n**Isaiah 6:5-7** records Isaiah's encounter:\n> \"Woe to me!\" I cried. \"I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.\" Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. With it he touched my mouth and said, \"See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.\"\n\nIsaiah recognized his speech problem before God, who immediately cleansed and commissioned him.\n\n**Application:** Confess impure speech to God. He can cleanse and commission you for powerful proclamation of truth.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Q: Do teeth dreams ever predict actual dental problems?\n\n**A:** While rare, some people report teeth dreams preceding actual dental issues. However, 95%+ of teeth dreams are symbolic, representing spiritual or emotional realities rather than physical predictions.\n\n**Wisdom:** If you have recurring teeth dreams AND haven't had a dental checkup recently, it might be worth a visit—but don't assume every teeth dream is a health warning.\n\n### Q: Why are teeth-falling-out dreams so common globally?\n\n**A:** Research shows these dreams occur across all cultures, suggesting universal human experiences of:\n- Fear of loss (power, influence, attractiveness)\n- Anxiety about aging and decline\n- Worry about communication failures\n- Concerns about loss of control\n\nSpiritually, universal commonality suggests enemy targets these areas, and God uses these dreams to reveal spiritual realities.\n\n### Q: Can teeth dreams be positive?\n\n**A:** Yes! When interpreted properly, they often carry positive messages:\n- Warning that helps you correct course before disaster\n- Revelation of root issues you can now address\n- Call to deeper maturity and spiritual strength\n- Opportunity for restoration and renewal\n\nEven disturbing dreams become blessings when they lead to spiritual growth and transformation.\n\n### Q: What if I have teeth dreams during spiritual warfare?\n\n**A:** Teeth dreams during warfare often indicate enemy attacks on your authority, voice, or power. Your response:\n\n**Spiritual Warfare Prayer:**\n- Take authority over demonic attacks in Jesus' name\n- Declare your authority as child of God (Luke 10:19)\n- Put on full armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)\n- Pray for angelic protection and strengthening\n- Refuse to accept powerlessness or voicelessness\n\n**Biblical Truth:** *\"No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you\"* (Isaiah 54:17)\n\n### Q: Should I stop speaking if I have these dreams?\n\n**A:** Generally no—but evaluate HOW you speak:\n- Stop destructive speech (gossip, lies, criticism)\n- Continue truthful, loving, edifying speech\n- Speak less if you've been speaking carelessly\n- Speak more if you've been silent when you should speak truth\n\n**Biblical Balance:** *\"There is a time to be silent and a time to speak\"* (Ecclesiastes 3:7)\n\n### Q: What if my teeth grow back in the dream?\n\n**A:** This is incredibly hopeful! It represents:\n- God's restoration of what was lost\n- Renewal of power, authority, and voice\n- New season after difficult transition\n- Resurrection after \"death\"\n\n**Biblical Promise:** *\"He makes all things new\"* (Revelation 21:5)\n\nThank God for this vision of restoration and prepare to receive what He's renewing in your life.\n\n## Conclusion: Restored Power and Redeemed Speech\n\nWhile dreams of teeth falling out are among the most common and anxiety-producing dreams, understanding their biblical symbolism transforms them from sources of fear into powerful spiritual messages. Whether God is warning about destructive speech, revealing loss of spiritual power, calling for deeper consecration, or preparing you for restoration, these dreams serve divine purposes.\n\nWhen you dream of losing teeth, God may be revealing:\n- The power and impact of your words (positive or negative)\n- Areas where spiritual compromise has weakened you\n- Loss of influence that can be restored through obedience\n- Warning about consequences of careless or destructive speech\n- His plan to restore and renew your spiritual authority\n\nRather than dismissing these dreams as mere anxiety, receive them as invitations to examine your speech, strengthen your spiritual foundation, address areas of compromise, and trust God for restoration of power and authority in your life.\n\nJust as God cleansed Isaiah's lips with a coal from the altar and commissioned him to speak prophetically, He can cleanse, restore, and empower your speech for His purposes. Every loss in dreams can become opportunity for greater restoration in reality.\n\n**Final Encouragement:**\n\n> \"He set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.\" (Psalm 40:2-3)\n\nMay God establish your foundations firmly, restore any power lost through compromise, guard your speech for His glory, and fill your mouth with testimony of His faithfulness and truth.\n\n---\n\n*Have you experienced teeth dreams that led to spiritual breakthrough or transformation?
