    "raw": "\nThe number 7 echoes through scripture like a divine drumbeat—seven days of creation, seven seals in Revelation, seven loaves feeding the multitude. We’re often told it means \"perfection\" or \"completion,\" and that’s true enough. But is that the whole story?\n\nThe Bible doesn’t settle for simple labels, and neither should we. Let’s peel back the layers of 7 and see what surprises it holds.\n\nStart with Genesis: God rests on the seventh day, sanctifying it. Perfection, sure—but it’s also a pause, a moment of stillness before humanity’s story unfolds. Fast forward to Revelation, where seven seals unleash chaos, not bliss.\n\nSeven trumpets blare judgment; seven bowls pour wrath. Completion, yes—but of what? Destruction before renewal.\n\nThen there’s Mary Magdalene—seven demons cast out (Luke 8:2). Her healing isn’t \"perfect\" in the pristine sense; it’s messy, a wrestle with darkness before freedom.\n\n![Mary Magdalene-seven demons cast out](images/Mary-Magdalene-seven-demons-cast-out-796x1024.webp)\n\nSeven isn’t just a neat bow on God’s work. It’s a rhythm—order giving way to disruption, then restoration. Think of Joshua circling Jericho seven times: the walls didn’t stand in flawless glory; they fell.\n\nSeven marks God’s process, not just His polish. Even in the Tabernacle, seven lamps burned—not for show, but to light the way through shadows.\n\n**Takeaway:** Next time you see 7 in scripture—or your life—don’t assume it’s all tidy and done. It might be God breaking something open to make it whole. Where’s your Jericho wall trembling?\n",
